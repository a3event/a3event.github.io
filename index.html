	<p><span class="t1t2">T1 (0.5%) and T2 (1%)</span> are very competitive and are mainly for bragging rights as they reward exclusive badges. It is not recommended to aim for these tiers without bloomed event gacha cards and/or hundreds of gems on hand.</p>
	
	<p>The most important tiers are <span class="t3">T3 (2%)</span> and <span class="t4t5">T5 (10%)</span>, as they are the minimum tiers that reward at least one copy of the event SSR at the end of the event.</p>
	<p><span class="t6">T6 (20%)</span> is still a decent tier to be in as those who obtained the SR reward can fully bloom their SR.</p>
	<p>Tiers below T6 are intended for beginners, casual players, and those uninterested in tiering.</p><br>

	<p>Without any event cards and minimal gem usage, an active player can expect to rank within T4 to T6 (5%-20%) during a competitive event, and in a less competitive event as high as T3 (2%).</p>

	<div class="box">

	<h2>General Tips</h2>
	
	<p>(I won't count the first few hours after maintenance as a full event day for simplicity's sake. Events last either 9 or 10 full days.)</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Do all four types of shows (Matinee, Soiree, Finale, Encore) at least once each for the 5 gems (total of 20 gems).</li>
		<li>Matinee shows have a higher chance of appearing than Soirees and Finales. Encores are said to appear 25% of the time after doing any of the other three shows.</li>
		<li>Know how long the event will last. Some will last 10 full days, others 9 days. Events that are a day shorter can cause some players to be unable to reach their goal in time, particularly the 1.15mil SSR reward.</li>
		<li>Manage your resources carefully throughout the event. You will be showered with prizes in the first two days, but they can dry up just as quickly. Keep an eye on the upcoming Kame boxes and Bentos you'll receive as you inch closer to reward milestones.</li>
		<li>Don't hoard all of your items until the very last day unless you think you can use them all quickly enough.</li>
		<li>You don't <span class="text2">have</span> to do every show. A show that expires stays at the same level the next time you encounter it. The level will only go down (level 1 minimum) if you cancel it.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>If you are not ranking:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Patience is key. Don’t worry about your ranking in the first 3 or 4 days of an event; many players will rush to get to the top. Your ranking should stabilize by the 4th or 5th day. The days in the middle (5, 6, 7, 8) slow down as players exhaust their gems and kame boxes. There will be another rush during the last day of an event, but there will be a notable amount of players who will stop trying after reaching certain milestones (particularly the 1.15mil SSR reward).</li>
		<li>You shouldn't have an issue with LP running out. <h4>Bento/onigiri:</h4> Use most of them for the Friday/Weekend practices for trophies and coach cards. Consider saving one or two of them for the remainder of the event in case, or rely on ranking up refills/the ones you'll get from rewards later on.</li>
		<li><h4>Kame buns/boxes:</h4> save for Encores.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>If you plan to rank:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Your ranking should stabilize by the 2nd or 3rd full day.</li>
		<li>It's possible to get by with just free LP and not have to spend gems on LP refills. <h4>Bento/onigiri:</h4> save them for the event practices. You can probably use some for the Friday/Weekend practices, but always keep enough on hand for the amount of gems you plan to use.</li>
		<li><h4>Kame buns/boxes:</h4> they are interchangeable with gems. You WILL spend gems.</li>
		<li><h4>Borderline Fighting & Safety:</h4> Be prepared for last-day borderline fighting between those close to the borderline and those just underneath it. It can be hectic and stressful, especially during the <span class="rtxt">Bloodbath</span> (the last two hours before an event ends). Alternatively, you can attempt to rank higher than you normally have to for security. You are considered <span class="gtxt">"safe"</span> when you are in a position that is much higher than the borderline of your goal tier and can stop playing during the <span class="rtxt">Bloodbath</span>. This position varies by tier and by event competitiveness, but generally you should be safe within the "Top 40%" of the tier. The safe range also includes players who are trying to get into the tier above them. Estimated safe points:
		<ul><li>For T1 (Top 0.5%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 0.1%-0.2%. Those in 0.3% should be safe due to the larger point gaps in this tier. Players near the bottom of 0.4% and below are <span class="rtxt">not</span> safe and must keep doing shows to keep their rank. Most players will only be fighting over 0.5%.</li>
		<li>For T1 (Top 1%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 0.6%-0.7%. Bottom of 0.8% and below are <span class="rtxt">not</span> safe.</li>
		<li>For T3 (Top 2%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 1.1%-1.3%. Due to the slightly higher competition, players in 1.4% <span class="text2">might</span> be safe. Bottom of 1.5% and below are <span class="rtxt">not</span> safe.</li>
		<li>For T4 (Top 5%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 2.1%-4.0%. Due to the much lower competition, players even at 4.5% <span class="text2">might</span> be safe.</li>
		<li>T1 to T3 borders can increase by roughly 100,000 Pts <span class="text2">(Seasonal: 1,000)</span> alone during the <span class="rtxt">Bloodbath</span>. The point gaps of players near the borders will shrink dramatically as the safe players in the top of their tier stop playing.</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	

	<h3>If you don’t have the event cards:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Cancel all Matinees. They are not worth doing without event cards.</li>
	<li>Either do Soirees for 1 SP max (cancel if it will cost 2), or cancel them ALL alongside Matinees. Without event cards, Soirees don’t give as many points compared to Finales and Encores -- plus you won’t be able to do level 19+ Soirees consistently due to the high pass requirements. However, doing Soirees give more chances for Encores to show up. Alternatively, you may consider doing Soirees only after you've obtained the event reward SR/SSR, in which case the Soirees are worth <span class="text2">slightly</span> more with the bonuses.</li>
	<li>Do Finales for 2-4 SP max (usually 2-3 SP).</li>
	<li>Do Encores for 3-6 SP max (usually 4-5 SP).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>If you do have event cards:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>You may consider doing Matinees for 1 SP if you expect to be low on LP. Keep in mind that 1 SP Soirees are always worth more points than Matinees (a level 50 Matinee for 1 SP ~= level 15 Soiree for 1 SP).</li>
	<li>Soirees are worth doing now due to the extra bonus points received per show. You will also be able to do higher level Soirees (19+). Depending on one's bonus points, they can be on par, if not higher value than even 2 SP Finales.</li>
	<li>Do Soirees for 1 SP only. Cancel Soiree if you can’t do it for 1 SP.</li>
	<li>Do Finales for 2-3 SP max (usually 2 SP, 3 SP is not ideal).</li>
	<li>Do Encores for 3-4 SP max (usually 4 SP).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>A relaxing way to play the events. Casual players are just as important in helping the Top 10% rank. <span class="text2">Thanks guys!</span><p>
	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Use up all of your free items. Bento/onigiri will help you rank up for a free refill. Kame buns/boxes will be more valuable than ever.</p>
	<p>Login at least four different days to get an extra kame box.</p>

	<br>
	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward, with minimal gems.</p><br>
	
	<p>Relies on using your natural SP (and LP) refills.</p>
	<p>You normally have 5 SP max (overfills to 10 max). Each SP takes 20 minutes to regenerate. From 0 SP at a timer of 19:59, it takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to completely refill all SP.</p>
	<p>Use up as much free SP as possible every time you play. If you need one more SP for a Finale, you can wait for it to regen and maximize your refill timer (that is, if a surprise Encore doesn't show up). If you only have 1 SP remaining and need 3 for a Finale, it is recommended to just let it expire (in this case the timer for full SP will be 20 mins shorter).</p>
	<p>App notifications can be turned on to tell you when your SP is full.</p>
	<p>Sleeping is recommended.</p>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>I would shorten the wait time to 1 hour and 30 minutes max, so that there are still 10 minutes to do event practices in case Matinees keep showing up (and thus "wasting" the timer for the next SP regen).</p>
	<p>Set an alarm or write down the time for when you should check the app again. And no need to stress if you come back to a full SP bar.</p>

	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>It's possible to obtain the SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) by playing everyday and still get 8 hours of sleep.</p>

	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward, but quicker.</p><br>
	
	<p>An optimization strategy for when you don't have the gacha cards.</p>
	<p>Once you have enough strong cards, 2 SP Finales of the same attribute as the gacha SSRs/SRs can be done somewhat consistently. The best cards from friends and guests can save you an SP, but sometimes they just won’t appear, no matter how many times you tap "Update".</p>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Do as many 2 SP Finales as you can to maximize points. You will obtain 1,000+ Pts more per SP on average than doing a 1 SP Soiree at	level 18 or below.</p>
	<p>Always cancel Matinee and Soiree.</p>
	<p>Have at least 1 SP on hand before doing more practices.</p>
	<p>If it will cost 3 SP to do a Finale, let the timer on them run out (do not cancel). This means you’re going to be checking the app again after waiting 20+ minutes.</p>
	<p>The next time you get a show, they "refresh" so the Finale may have a different attribute.</p>
	<p>Only do Finales for 3 SP if your SP is full or close to being refilled.</p>
	
	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>It's possible to obtain the SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) by playing everyday and still get 8 hours of sleep.</p>

	<p>Rank, with gacha cards.</p><br>

	<p>So you went all-out on the banner. You have all three of the event cards bloomed once, or perhaps two of them fully bloomed.</p>
	<p>Your overpowered cards will help you rank easier due to:
	<ul>
		<li>Additional bonus points per show (they add up quickly)</li>
		<li>Less SP to do shows</li>
		<li>Less gems spent on SP refills compared to those without event cards (besides the amount you blew on the banner).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Keep doing event practices and spend gems on SP refills.</p>
	<p>You could either rush to the top and slow down after getting the event SSR, or play frequently everyday (the SSR can be achieved more reasonably by the 4th full day).</p>
	
	<h4>VARIATION:</h4>
	<p>Only spend gems on the gacha, and little to none for SP refills. T3 is possible with just one fully bloomed card, depending on how competitive the event is. Unless you lucked out and have a team of five fully bloomed gacha cards, you'll likely be spending additional gems on top of the gacha for T1/T2.</p>
	
	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>If you save all of your bentos and onigiris for only the event practices, then you can avoid spending any additional gems on LP refills.</p>

		<li>Will the gacha SSR also be useful in future events? <span class="text2">(See: <a href="#roster">Actor Management</a>)</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If not, then you can ignore the gacha altogether.</p>

	<p>Generally, spending gems on refills is better value since it is a more guaranteed way to rank highly. On the other hand, gacha is random and isn't guaranteed to give you the event cards.</p>
	<p>Your gems are better spent on Finales and Encores. But if you cancel all Soirees alongside Matinees, you may have issues with LP.</p>

	<h2>Friend and Guest Supports</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The game encourages you to use different supports throughout the day (the number 10 indicating friend points will show if you haven't used them yet), because using the same friend/guest too many times in a day makes them not appear again for a while, limiting your support options. It appears that the friend points may reset in ~12 hours as opposed to the next day.</li>

		<li>If you send a friend request to another player and it stays as pending, then you cannot see or use that player’s cards until the request is either accepted by the receiver (Friend) or revoked by you (the sender). This is probably because the game doesn’t allow you to send a request again to the same player while a current request is pending. (Using a guest support prompts you to send a friend request)</li>

		<li>There is a specific range of players you can see (who can also see you), which can vary between accounts and is possibly tied to your player ID. This range is estimated to be a tiny percentage of the entire player base and likely increases as new players join. It may be advantageous to have friends who are outside of this range (i.e. added from the "Find" section in Friends, offsite, from an alt account). This is why many players you see in the rankings will normally never show up on your support list.
		<ul>
		<li>During The Stranger event, there were around 12,000 players who participated in the event, and ~1,200 players (Top 10%) who obtained the SSR reward. With two fully bloomed cards with max lead skills, I was receiving 110 usages on average by players daily. I estimate the range to be from about 60-120 active (Top 10%) players (and about 600 to 1,200 including all the inactive/casual players).</li>
		<li>Friend points refresh after ~12 hours so the usage of a guest support from the same player can count up to twice a day.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>Don't be a party pooper. Share your gacha cards if you pulled them to thank friends and guests who helped you! =)</li>

	<h2>Theater</h2>

	<p>If the event has a play, tickets will be given from the point rewards and rarely from practice. Every point counts! Base points are 500 per ticket. Similarly to doing shows, every event card you use gives additional bonus points per ticket.</p><br>

	<p>Each unique actor will only count once. You can’t use both the unbloomed & bloomed version of the same card for additional points. Besides that, it doesn't matter where the actors are placed (Supporting Actor D counts too).</p>

	<p>Only bloomed event cards double as original, so you can't use the unbloomed SR/SSR rewards as original cast.</p>
	
	<p>Don't forget to use your tickets before the event ends!</p><br>
	
	<img src="src/ss_03.png">

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Wait until you've obtained the SR/SSR rewards before using all of your tickets as they count for bonus points.</p>
	<p>If you're the forgetful type or just want to be safe, use one ticket for the badge and save the rest of the tickets for after you have the event SR/SSR. The 100% completion badge will not be available after the event ends.</p>
	<p>If you have the gacha cards (R card + others), watch a play with the original cast AFTER the event ends, since you can obtain the "Original cast and costumes" badge even after the event ends.</p>

	<h2>Rookie Mistakes</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Accidentally pressing “Start Show” instead of “Cancel” on a Matinee. There is no confirmation to start a show if you have enough SP. <span class="text2">(So many Matinees in a row...)</span></li>
	<li>Accidentally pressing “Start Show” with the wrong boost amount. Always make sure you will <span class="rtxt">pass</span> a show before confirming! <span class="text2">(Ended up wasting an extra SP to pass the show)</span></li>
	<li>Being shy of a couple hundred points to passing a Finale or Encore with the ideal SP amount. Figuring out which cards to train at the last minute isn’t the greatest idea. Be prepared if you want to rank! Set up your teams with optimal link skills in advance and keep in mind other possible link skill combos you could use once you obtain the event SR/SSR. Have trophies and coach cards handy in case you do need them. <span class="text2">(I finished training a card I needed, panicked with seconds on the clock left -- misclicking the wrong boost -- wasting an SP, and then the show expired… yeah...)</span></li>
	<li>Waiting for one SP to regenerate and then forget to check the app again in time, coming back to an expired timer. It’s handy to write down the time or set an alarm, as short as the timers are, or leave the app idle if it’s only a couple of minutes. <span class="text2">(Still do this from time to time ;-; Not my 3 SP Encore… uhh pretend it never happened xD)</span></li>
	<li>Staying up late, then falling asleep in the middle of an event practice or while waiting for SP. <span class="text2">(Yup)</span></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Trivia</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In the case of a tie right at the borderline, the number of spots in that tier will temporarily increase for each player with the same amount of points, but will go back to normal as soon as the tie has been broken or the borderline has been overtaken.</li>
		<li>For Troupe events, the maximum bonus points that can be obtained per show is 2,550 Pts with five fully bloomed SSRs plus a fully bloomed SSR support (425 Pts each).</li>
		<li>For Seasonal events, the max bonus points is 24 Pts (scale to 2,400). These events are a little easier to obtain max bonus points for since ++ SRs give the same bonus points as ++ SSRs. An event with multiple SSRs/SRs (i.e. Say I Do!) and some luck makes this possible without having a bottomless wallet.</li>

		<li>Starting March 2020, 15 gems are given if the day is a character's birthday.</li>

		<h2>About Premium Tokens</h2>
		<p>Premium tokens are currently obtainable from ranking up and from event rewards.</p>
		<p>They can only be used for Premium Tryouts and the upcoming Birthday Tryouts <span class="text2">(predicted to start in June 2020)</span>.</p>
		<p>Use 5 tokens to do a single pull equivalent to the last pull (guaranteed SR) of a multi pull using gems.</p>
		<p>5 tokens are worth more than a single pull (15 gems) but definitely aren't worth more than one multi-pull (145 gems).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Beginners should pull on a banner several times and/or use their tokens for some much-needed SRs and SSRs. Once you have a decent amount of initial cards and no longer  rely on R cards, save your remaining tokens for the Birthday Tryouts.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Gem Management Tips</h2>
		<p>After reaching Rank 100+ with your legendary actor management skills, you've reached the endgame of A3! <span class="text2">where we all suffer in endless event hell</span> -- or as I like to call it, a "gem management" game. These shiny red diamonds are the limited resource for pulling the gacha and for ranking, besides shelling out for premium gems with real money.</p><br>
		<p>Free gems have little restrictions. The only things exclusive to premium gems are the infrequent one-time banner offers that allow you to choose a card of your liking, and a daily pull on Premium Tryouts for a discount. Neither are a necessity to progress.</p>
		<p>Saving gems takes willpower, but it's not impossible.</p>
		<img height="auto" src="src/ss_01.png"></img>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't pull on every banner.
				<ul>
				<li>You could ignore banners that don't have an event attached to them, as there is currently no guaranteed "pity system" implemented.</li>
				<li>You could ignore banners that don't feature your best boy(s) as the SSR/SR. <span class="text2">Sometimes, I ignore the featured SR of one of my best boys too if I don't care for the featured SSR(s).</span></li>
				<li>You could ignore a banner if you already own an actor's SSR card of the same attribute as the featured SSR. <span class="text2">(See: <a href="#roster">Actor Management</a>)</span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Ignore pulling just for R gacha cards.
				<ul>
				<li>Can be extended to ignoring event-exclusive badges, especially if you don't plan to rank in that event. Badges are purely aesthetic and reward only an extra jukebox track.</li>
				<li>Outside of events, R cards aren't useful in shows in the long run. Trained SSR and SR cards have higher stats <span class="text2">(and overall have better art)</span>. <span class="text2"></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Accept that you cannot rank (Top 0.5% - Top 2%) in every event.
				<ul>
				<li>F2P have limited gems and cannot expect to obtain all of the event SSRs fully bloomed without going broke. You do not <span class="text2">need</span> fully bloomed SSRs.</li>
				<li>It's possible to obtain the event SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) and tier as high as T4 (Top 5%) without spending a single gem. Keep the amount of gems spent minimal for events if you're not ranking (0-20 gems).</li>
				<li>Rank badges are for the "Itarus" and have no purpose outside of aesthetics and bragging rights. They reward 10 Premium Tokens (5 more than the other tiers) which aren't worth the additional gems spent to obtain them. <span class="text2">(You can only show off a maximum of two badges on your profile anyway...)</span></li>

		<h2>Tapjoy Offers</h2>
		<p>Ads and Tapjoy offers are unique to the EN server and the majority of offers are only available for Android devices. Offers include surveys, quizzes, and reaching certain milestones in downloaded promotional apps to receive extra gems. However, not all offers are made equal. The following thread contains lots of useful information about which offers to do and which offers to avoid.</p>

		</ul>
		<p>General tips:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Check the Play Store for ratings and reviews before starting an offer.</li>
			<li>Don't make careless in-app purchases or you might end up spending more than what the reward is worth. If you are strictly F2P, ignore the offers that require you to purchase something. Some offers can be completed for free; all you need is patience.</li>
			<li>Don't start an offer that will take days or weeks to complete while an A3! event is going on. Keep in mind that offers are time-limited and juggling between one and the event can be stressful.</li>

			<h2>Actor Management Tips</h2>
			<p>Free SSR cards from events are immensely helpful for F2P.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The ideal roster would be to have three SSRs of each of the 20 actors, one for each show type (Comedy, Action, Drama).</li>
				<li>If an SSR for that actor isn't available for the player to use, SRs are the next strongest cards. Fully bloomed SRs can be on par with unbloomed SSRs.</li>
				<li>Keep in mind that future cards have "powercreep" and have higher stats on average, especially their strongest attribute.</li>

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The number of players who obtain the event SSR reward increases dramatically on the last day. <span class="text2">Only ~0.1% of players have the event SSR in the first two days of an event.</span></li>
				<li>T4 (Top 5.0%) is the least competitive tier of the first five tiers. T4 (5%) and T5 (10%) mostly consist of players who've stopped playing shortly after reaching the 1.15mil milestone.</li>
				<li>Reaching the SR reward milestone (700k Pts) guarantees a placement in the Top 20%.</li>
				<li>The events considered the most competitive are: "Alex in Wonderland" [1], "The Stranger" [4]. <span class="text2">The Top 1% and 2% borders for "The Stranger" are unusually higher than average.</span></li>
				<li>The events considered the least competitive are: "Campfire Bonds" [3] by far. There were a notable lack of supports compared to other events. <span class="text2">The bloomed Citron card is currently the rarest event card.</span></li>
				<li>The number of players participating in events has decreased over time. Approximately half of the total number of players start on the 1st day of an event <span class="text2">(~6,400 players played within the 1st full day of the "Mystery" event [6])</span>. </li>
				<li>The gap between the Top 20% and the Top 10% has shrunk, with the Top 20% being higher on average and the Top 10% being lower on average.</li>
				<li>Overall, events that are more recent have been more competitive than before (i.e. The "Mystery" event [6] has numbers comparable to the "Sardines" event [2], but the "Sardines" event lasted an extra day).</li>

		<h2>Other tidbits</h2>
		
		<p>A maximum of six actors can activate any number of link skills (five from your roster plus one guest).</p>
		<p>Besides relying on event cards, it's important to use unique actors and combinations to pass shows using minimal SP.</p>
		<p>Link skills consisting of at least three actors (24% boost and up) are all important to cover for future events. Some of these are exclusive to just those actors (i.e. Comedy: Sakuya, Masumi, and Tasuku do not combine with any others), so other link skills or event cards have to be used.</p>
		<p>Link skills consisting of two actors (12% boost) can help round off your team. Arguably, the 12% skills that can't be combined with any other link skill are the least important to cover, even during events. You are likely better off using a stronger card or other link skill combos.</p><br>
		
		<p>The following 12% boost link skill combinations currently cannot be combined with any other link skills:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Action: Kazunari + Azuma</li>
			<li>Drama: Tenma + Yuki</li>
			<li>Drama: Muku + Juza</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>If you're not familiar with the actors by name, the wiki guide has images.</p>
		<p>There is a useful filter in-game to search for a specific actor.</p>

		<h2>What it's like to rank as F2P</h2>
		<p>This section isn't really a guide, but perhaps it can provide insight for those who haven't touched the top ranks.</p>
		<p>Here's my experience with the first competitive event I attempted to rank in. It was such a fun and enjoyable experience and I would love to rank again in the future. If you haven't ranked before, I would totally recommend trying it out!</p>

Feb 12 and 13 (Day 1 and 5 hours):
HONEYMOON!
OMG STRANGER IS AN AWESOME PLAY EVERYONE LOOKS COOL
CRY FOR OMI
TAICHI CHEERS OMI UP ;;
OMI LOVED NACHI & CRAZY WOLF GANG, AND NOW HIS FELLOW TROUPE MEMBERS
I NEED 4x SSR OMI TO GO WITH MY EXTRA SSR TAICHI
I GOT ALL THE GACHA CARDS I AM MORE THAN READY!!!
My ranking isn't as bad as I expected. 9.9% within the first 5 hours ("day" 1) then 3.0% on second day. Off to a good start!

Feb 14 (Day 2):
@458,810 pts, spent 1 gem (3.0%)
@523,610 spent 9 gems and all kame rewards obtained (1.5%)
@647,869 = 34 gems, all but 1 kame box (1.1%)
Feb 15 (Day 3):
@794,723 Pts = 52 gems, all kame (1.0%)
@915,453 Pts = 70 gems, all kame (0.9-1.0%)
Feb 16 (Day 4):
@1,244,313 Pts = 90 gems, all kame (1.0% all day, 0.9% after getting Omi), 15 tickets, played all day
Feb 17 (Day 5):
@1,493,321 Pts = 103 gems, all kame (0.8% fairly consistently, 0.7% by end of day), played all day

After 5 days into the event, I feel like people are slowing down a bit from a lack of gems. On the 6th day I barely dropped % at all. I am contemplating whether to try to get into the 0.5%. The reward is 50 more gems and an extra copy of the SSR. I will definitely be spending more than 50 gems just to get in, and then more gems everyday just to stay there -- especially during the last two days of the event.
Spending 50 gems at this point will help me reach the bottom of 0.5%, while an additional 100 gems will get me in 0.4%. I might think about doing a sneak attack closer to the end of the event, gauging how much the border grows first during those brutal last days. If it's really that crazy then I'll just focus on staying in Top 1.0% instead.

Feb 18 (Day 6):
@1,744,777 Pts = 122 gems, still have 3 kame boxes from the 1.6m reward. Trying to stay in 0.6% so that I have the opportunity to do a sneak attack on the final day. xD
After 6 days of the event, the Top 0.5% border has already surpassed Campfire Bonds' final Top 0.5% border. At this rate it may even surpass Alex in Wonderland's.
Feb 19 (Day 7):
@1,979,236 = 130 gems, no kame :(

Trying to keep steady in 0.6% close to the bottom of 0.5%, but not surpassing it... oops didn't mean to but did surpass it at one point due to a surprise encore. Now enjoying 0.5% at times :p idk if I should try to get into 0.4 and worry less about dropping out of T1. The gap for that is another ~24 gems worth of points...
I think I have enough bentos for the rest of the event. Unless Matinee keeps showing up.
I missed THREE frickin Encores for 3 SP now. You know what... just pay gems upfront and don't even wait anymore. SERIOUSLY ARRRRGGGHHH SO FRUSTRATING!!! >:(
At this point you wish for the event to end...

Feb 20 (Day 8):
2,205,324 =143 gems + 2 kame reward. Did my attack into 0.4%/top of 0.5% starting today, taking advantage of the rank up LP, and try to maintain 0.5% (expect to drop a bit) on the last day.
A total of 150 gems spent would be ideal since its the 0.5% reward prize :p But it's expected to become hectic in the last day so idk. Hoping not to spend over 200 gems.
Feb 21 (Day 9):
2,375,607 = 143gems, 1 kame

I'm quite ahead now and am not worrying about my rank so much, which is a nice change of pace. Just gotta keep up the rank!
Having some trouble sleeping the last two days tho ;; Hope to get some good sleep after it finally ends.
Have a gap of about 40 gems (150k Pts)

Feb 22 (Day 10, last day):
END ME
I AM FORCING MYSELF TO STAY UP
I AM DYING
I ALSO FELL ASLEEP AND WASTED MY CAPPED LP AND SP from rank up AAAAHHH
(At least I have 5 bentos - enough for the whole day)
The border is catching up faster and faster. Still confident I can stay in 0.5... barely.
Geez I even used 2 SP on a Soiree bc I thought it was a Finale. I am so out of it right now. >< I still pop up on the bottom of 0.4% (even after all these mess ups) but that's bc the point gaps have become much closer, but I better pay attention for the rest of the day.
I haven't done any Encores if it means spending even one gem. This event isn't getting any more of my gems ><
@8:00AM PST: 24 gem gap (0.4) 75k
@3:00PM: 19 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 60k
@5:00PM: 14 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 44k
@7:00PM: 11 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 35k
@8:30PM: 9 gem gap (0.5) 30k
The 0.4% top is 2.603m Pts. The bottom of 0.5% is 2.502m Pts. So there is only a ~100k point difference between 24 players.
0.6% bottom is 2.408m, so another 12 players have a ~100k point difference between them.
Looks like some have given up on 0.5%, but surprise last-minute people are spending gems like crazy and sneaking in 0.5.
Luckily it looks like I'm just barely able to rank up one more time for some much needed SP.
@9:30PM: 12 gem gap (0.5) 36k
Ranked up...
@10:50PM: 6 gem gap 19k while waiting for SP to refill... without that rank up I am forced to spend more gems :o
@11:00PM: 4 gem gap 12k SH***T I NEED TO SPEND
@11:10PM: 6 gem gap 20k. Spent 5 gems. reached 2.6m Pts
@11:25PM: 6 gem gap, 20k. Spent 7 gems
@11:30PM: F*** I THINK IM DED. 2 gems 5k point gap... wut happened
@11:45PM: 10 gem gap 30k. I think I'm ok... but frantically checking ranking every minute.
@11:50PM: 6 gem gap, 18k. Didn't spend anything more or do practices, but have a finale ready just in case.
@11:59PM: I AM EXACTLY ON THE BORDER HOLY MOLY!!! There's a gap of 6k Pts or so to the person below me...
*Waits the full 10 minutes of maintenance dreadfully*
After maint: Right on the border. *Faints* I am never ranking again.

Post-event analysis: the gap was actually 6,842 Pts. A Finale gives 4,952 Pts without bonus Pts so 6,752 Pts with the two event reward cards, one copy of each bloomed ++ gacha card and SSR ++ guest support, so I -might- have been safe either way. ...unless the show was an Encore or if they somehow had five fully bloomed event cards. o.O
		</textarea>
		
		<img height="240px" src="src/ss_02.png"></img>
		
		<p>Had the fully bloomed SSR and R card both with lead skill lv 10, an unbloomed SR, and an extra unbloomed SSR I could use for Action shows.</p><br>
		
		<p>SP usage: Did Soirees for 1 SP (level 22 avg). 2 SP for every Finale. 4 SP for Co/Dr Encores, 3 SP for Ac Encores.</p>
		
		<p>Total gems spent to rank in T1: 164. Doesn't -seem- like a lot, but I spent a ton on the gacha so...</p>
		
		<p>I did not spend any gems to refill LP.</p>
		
		<p>Average Pts per day: 261,000. This is almost double my normal amount (135,000 without gacha cards or gems).</p>
		
		<p>Average support usage: 110 times per day.</p><br>
		
		<p>From this event, I learned that clowns really do exist. You thought one fully bloomed card of an actor was enough. No. These so-called "Itarus" try to obtain MULTIPLE FULLY BLOOMED gacha cards, even of the same actor. Their team would be for example one Taichi ++, two Juzas ++, and two Sakyos ++. This is the only way I can explain why some players could get past me in the ranks quicker than I had anticipated, because their bonus points reached 2,000+ per show compared to my average of ~1,350.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I am a Day 1/2 player (started in October 2019) who wanted to share my knowledge of A3! with the EN community. When I played my first event, it was initially new and exciting <span class="text2">(Omg shows can pop up in the middle of practice?!)</span>. But as days went by, I soon felt the exhaustion, was overwhelmed with all of the underlying mechanics (i.e. link skills, timers, SP usage), and felt like I wasted so many gems. I am thankful to the Subreddit and those who came from the other servers giving tips on how to play the game more efficiently, and became intrigued with the complexity of event mechanics.</p>
		<p>I'd be happy if this guide helped even a little. Perhaps it can spice up the competition a bit. ;)</p><br>
