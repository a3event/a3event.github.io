	<p>Average bonus points from friend/guest support appears to be 225, but may vary based on the popularity of the event and the player's "friend range" <span class="text2">(See: Friend and Guest Supports)</span>. In a less popular event, it can be more difficult to find event cards. And no matter what event it is, I usually have trouble finding fully bloomed SSR supports, while another player may have trouble finding fully bloomed SRs.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Fully Bloomed ++ cards have their stats multiplied by 4.
		<ul>
		<li>SSR max: 24,000-24,760    SR max: 18,064-18,992    R max: 13,680-14,420</li></ul>
		</li>
	<li>Bloomed + cards have their stats multiplied by 3.
		<ul>
		<li>SSR max: 17,100-17,640    SR max: 12,738-13,374    R max: 9,510-10,005</li></ul>

	</ul>
	<p>(These numbers can be higher with future card releases. For example, Wedding Tsumugi and Wedding Sakyo have higher stats than a normal SSR)</p>

	<p><span class="t1t2">T1 (0.5%) and T2 (1%)</span> are very competitive and are mainly for bragging rights as they reward exclusive badges. It is not recommended to aim for these tiers without bloomed event gacha cards and/or hundreds of gems on hand.</p>
	
	<p>The most important tiers are <span class="t3">T3 (2%)</span> and <span class="t4t5">T5 (10%)</span>, as they are the minimum tiers that reward at least one copy of the event SSR at the end of the event.</p>
	<p><span class="t6">T6 (20%)</span> is still a decent tier to be in as those who obtained the SR reward can fully bloom their SR, which are as good as unbloomed SSRs.
	Tiers below T6 are intended for beginners, casual players, and those uninterested in tiering.</p>

	<p>Without any event cards and minimal gem usage, an active player can expect to rank within T4 to T6 (5%-20%) during a competitive event, and in a less competitive event as high as T3 (2%).</p>

	<div class="box">

	<h2>General Tips</h2>
	
	<p>(I won't count the first few hours of an event as "Day 1" here for simplicity's sake. Events last either 9 or 10 full days.)
	
	<h3>If you aren't ranking:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Patience is key. Don’t worry about your ranking in the first 3 or 4 days of an event; many players will rush to get to the top. By the 4th or 5th day, your ranking should stabilize. The days in the middle (5, 6, 7, 8) slow down as players exhaust their gems and kame boxes. There will be another rush during the last day of an event, but there will be a notable amount of players who will stop trying after reaching certain milestones (particularly the 1.15mil SSR reward).</li>
		<li><h4>Bento/onigiri:</h4> use for the Friday/Weekend practices (trophies/coach cards). You can even rank up a couple of times for some free SP.</li>
		<li><h4>Kame buns/boxes:</h4> save for Encores. Don't hoard all of them until the very last day unless you think you can use them all quickly enough.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>If you plan to rank:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Your ranking should stabilize by the 2nd or 3rd full day.</li>
		<li><h4>Bento/onigiri:</h4> save them for the event practices. You can probably use some for the Friday/Weekend practices but always keep enough on hand. It's possible to get by with just free LP while ranking and not have to spend gems on LP refills.</li>
		<li><h4>Kame buns/boxes:</h4> they are interchangeable with gems. You WILL spend gems.</li>
		<li>Be prepared for borderline fighting; it can be hectic and stressful. You are not "safe" unless you are in a position at least +0.2% higher than the borderline hours before the event ends. (i.e. At the 0.5% borderline, being in 0.3% should be safe -- but keep doing shows in case, and 0.1-0.2% is definitely safe. Most players will only be fighting over 0.4% and 0.5%). The borderline can increase by 100,000+ Pts within the last three hours of an event.</li>
	</ul>
	
	

	<h3>If you don’t have the event cards:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Avoid spending gems to refill LP; use onigiri, bentos, and refills from ranking up and natural regen. If you are not planning to use a lot of gems, you should not have an issue with LP.</li>
	<li>Cancel all Matinees (after doing it once for the gems). They are not worth doing without event cards.</li>
	<li>You may either do Soiress for 1 SP only, or consider cancelling all Soirees. Without event cards they don’t give as many points compared to Finales and Encores, plus you won’t be able to do level 19+ Soirees due to the high pass requirements. If you manage to obtain the 1.15mil reward before the end of the event and can use both event SSR+SR rewards in your shows, Soirees can be done then.</li>
	<li>Do Finales for 2-4 SP max (usually 2-3 SP).</li>
	<li>Do Encores for 3-6 SP max (usually 4-5 SP).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>If you do have event cards:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>You may consider doing Matinees for 1 SP if you expect to be low on LP.
	Soirees are worth it now due to the extra bonus points. Do Soirees for 1 SP only. Cancel Soiree if you can’t do it for 1 SP.</li>
	<li>Do Finales for 2-3 SP max (usually 2 SP, 3 SP is not ideal).</li>
	<li>Do Encores for 3-4 SP max (usually 4 SP).</li>
	</ul>
	
	

	<p>A level 50 Matinee (1 SP) is worth about the same as a level 15 Soiree (1 SP). However the Matinee has a higher pass requirement. If you can fulfill this high requirement for 1 SP, then you are also able to do the higher level Soirees (18+) that are worth more points.</p>

	<p>At a high level (24+), 1 SP Soirees can be worth more than 2 SP Finales if they can be done with most to all of the event cards, but you'll rarely be able to do them so it’s not significant.</p>

	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward.</p><br>
	
	<p>Relies on using your natural SP (and LP) refills.</p>
	<p>You normally have 5 SP max (overfills to 10 max). Each SP takes 20 minutes to regenerate. From 0 SP at a timer of 19:59, it takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to completely refill all SP.</p>
	<p>Use up as much free SP as possible every time you play. If you need one more SP for a Finale, you can wait for it to regen and maximize your refill timer (that is, if a surprise Encore doesn't show up). If you only have 1 SP remaining and need 3 for a Finale, it is recommended to just let it expire (note that the timer will be 1h 20m max instead for full SP).</p>
	<p>App notifications can be turned on to tell you when your SP is full.</p>
	<p>Sleeping is recommended.</p>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>1 hour and 30 minutes is the max amount of time that I would wait for, so that there are still 10 minutes to do event practices in case Matinees keep showing up (and thus "wasting" the timer for the next SP regen).</p>
	<p>Set an alarm or write down the time for when you should check the app again. And no need to stress if you come back to a full SP bar.</p>

	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>It's possible to obtain the SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) by playing everyday and still get 8 hours of sleep.</p>

	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward, but quicker.</p><br>
	
	<p>An optimization strategy for when you don't have the gacha cards.</p>
	<p>Once you have enough strong cards, 2 SP Finales of the same attribute as the gacha SSRs/SRs can be done somewhat consistently. The best cards from friends and guests can save you an SP, but sometimes they just won’t appear, no matter how many times you update.</p>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Do as many 2 SP Finales as you can to maximize points. You will obtain 1,000+ Pts more per SP on average than doing a 1 SP Soiree at	level 18 or below.</p>
	<p>Always cancel Matinee and Soiree.</p>
	<p>Have at least 2 SP on hand before doing more practices.</p>
	<p>If it will cost 3 SP to do a Finale, let the timer on them run out (do not cancel). This means you’re going to be checking the app again after waiting 20+ minutes.</p>
	<p>Only do Finales for 3 SP if your SP is full or close to being refilled.</p>
	
	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>It's possible to obtain the SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) by playing everyday and still get 8 hours of sleep.</p>

	</ul></td><td width="40%">
	<h4 class="rtxt">Cons</h4>
	<ul>

	<li>You will run out of LP faster. Not recommended to combine with excessive gem spending, or you may find yourself spending gems on LP as well.</li>

	<h3>The “For best boy” strategy</h3>

	Difficulty: Easy
	Stress level: Low
	Tiers to aim for: T1-T3 (Top 0.5%-2%)
	F2P: Not F2P-friendly

	Just spend your gems on SP refills.
	It is recommended to have at least two bloomed event cards and some good friend supports to use.

	You may consider doing any show that comes your way -- even the Matinees -- as you might not have enough LP from just the bentos, onigiri, and free refills from rank ups.
	You may or may not spend gems to refill LP as well. Personally, I would avoid doing so.

	Cons
	Your poor gems...
	</div>

	<div class="box2">
	<h3>The “No Gacha” strategy (untested)</h3>

	Difficulty: Medium
	Stress level: Medium
	Tiers to aim for: T1-T3 (Top 0.5%-2%)
	F2P: Not recommended for beginners

	Is pulling on the gacha banner for the bonus points better value than using your gems for refills only?

	Two questions to ask yourself:
	Are the boys featured on the banner your best boys?
	Will the banner SSR also be useful in future events? (Likely so if you don’t already own an SSR of the featured boy)
	If not, then you might want to consider ignoring the gacha altogether.

	I haven’t tried this strategy before, but in theory it should be effective (so long as you have the gems to spare and enough trained actors), being a more guaranteed way of ranking highly. On the other hand, gacha is random and you may never even pull the event cards.

	Pros
	This strat combined with the standard “1 hour and 30 minutes” should allow a player to compete with the top percentages without going overboard on gem spending.
	Not reliant on gacha. Guaranteed way to obtain lots of points, so long as there are enough gems.
	Cons
	Not a good strategy for beginners. You will waste a TON of gems without team optimization.
	Doesn’t feel rewarding, as you will get the minimal amount of points per gem spent. You’ll have to do more shows to get the same amount of points compared to those with event bonuses.
	</div>

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	A player with two fully bloomed cards can earn, on average, double the amount of Pts/SP vs. a player without any event cards.

	Let’s say that the “No Gacha” player will also rush to obtain the event SSR as soon as possible. Then the free cards technically cancel each other out? On second thought… unless the players with event cards are able to use all of them as much as possible due to their overpowered bloomed cards, while the “No Gacha” player may not always be able to use the unbloomed cards to pass shows.

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	<h2>Friend and Guest Supports</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The game encourages you to use different supports throughout the day (the number 10 indicating friend points will show if you haven't used them yet), because using the same friend/guest too many times in a day makes them not appear again for a while, limiting your support options. It appears that the friend points may reset in ~12 hours as opposed to the next day.</li>

		<li>If you send a friend request to another player and it stays as pending, then you cannot see or use that player’s cards until the request is either accepted by the receiver (Friend) or revoked by you (the sender). This is probably because the game doesn’t allow you to send a request again to the same player while a current request is pending. (Using a guest support prompts you to send a friend request)</li>

		<li>There is a specific range of players you can see (who can also see you), which can vary between accounts and is possibly tied to your player ID. This range is estimated to be a tiny percentage of the entire player base and likely increases as new players join. It may be advantageous to have friends who are outside of this range (i.e. added from the "Find" section in Friends, offsite, from an alt account). This is why many players you see in the rankings will normally never show up on your support list.
		<ul>
		<li>During The Stranger event, there were around 12,000 players who participated in the event, and ~1,200 players (Top 10%) who obtained the SSR reward. With two fully bloomed cards with max lead skills, I was receiving 110 usages on average by players daily. I estimate the range to be from about 60-120 active (Top 10%) players (and about 600 to 1,200 including all the inactive/casual players).</li>
		<li>Friend points refresh after ~12 hours so the usage of a guest support from the same player can count up to twice a day.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>Don't be a party pooper. Share your gacha cards if you pulled them to thank friends and guests who helped you! =)</li>

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	<h2>Theater</h2>

	<p>If the event has a play, tickets will be given from the point rewards and rarely from practice. Every point counts! Base points are 500 per ticket, and every event card you use will add extra points.</p>

	<p>Each unique actor will only count once. You can’t use both the unbloomed & bloomed card of the same actor for additional points.</p>
	<p>The guest actor does not matter.</p>

	<p>Only bloomed event cards double as original, so you can't use the unbloomed SR/SSR rewards as original cast.</p>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Save up all of your tickets until you obtain the SR/SSR reward, as they also count for bonus points. Don't forget to use your tickets before the event ends!</p>
	<p>If you have the gacha cards (R card + others), watch a play with the original cast AFTER the event ends, since you can obtain that badge anytime.</p>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<h2>Trivia</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In the case of a tie right at the borderline, the number of spots in that tier will temporarily increase for each player with the same amount of points, but will go back to normal as soon as the tie has been broken or the borderline has been overtaken.</li>
		<li>For Troupe events, the maximum bonus points that can be obtained per show is 2,550 Pts with five fully bloomed SSRs plus a fully bloomed SSR support (425 Pts each).</li>
		<li>For Seasonal events, the max bonus points is 24 Pts (scale to 2,400). These events are a little easier to obtain max bonus points for since ++ SRs give the same bonus points as ++ SSRs. An event with multiple SSRs/SRs (i.e. Say I Do!) and some luck makes this possible without having a bottomless wallet.</li>
	</div>



	<div class="box">

	<h2>Rookie Mistakes</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Accidentally pressing “Start Show” instead of “Cancel” on a Matinee. There is no confirmation to start a show if you have enough SP. <span class="text2">(So many Matinees in a row...)</span></li>
	<li>Accidentally pressing “Start Show” with the wrong boost amount. Always make sure you will <span class="rtxt">pass</span> a show before confirming! <span class="text2">(Ended up wasting an extra SP to pass the show)</span></li>
	<li>Being shy of a couple hundred points to passing a Finale or Encore with the ideal SP amount. Figuring out which cards to train at the last minute isn’t the greatest idea. Be prepared if you want to rank! Set up your teams with optimal link skills in advance and keep in mind other possible link skill combos you could use once you obtain the event SR/SSR. Have trophies and coach cards handy in case you do need them. <span class="text2">(I panicked with seconds on the clock left -- misclicking the wrong boost -- wasting an SP, and then the show expired… yeah...)</span></li>
	<li>Waiting for one SP to regenerate and then forget to check the app again in time, coming back to an expired timer. It’s handy to write down the time or set an alarm, as short as the timers are, or leave the app idle if it’s only a couple of minutes. <span class="text2">(Still do this from time to time ;-; Not my 3 SP Encore… uhh pretend it never happened xD)</span></li>
	<li>Staying up late, then falling asleep in the middle of an event practice or while waiting for SP. <span class="text2">(Yup)</span></li>

		<h2>Gem Management Tips</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't pull on every banner.
				<ul>
				<li>You could choose to ignore all banners that don't have an event attached to them, as there is currently no guaranteed "pity system" implemented.</li>
				<li>You could choose to ignore all banners that don't feature your best boy(s) as the SSR/SR. <span class="text2">Sometimes, I ignore the featured SR of one of my best boys too if I don't care for the featured SSR(s).</span></li>
				<li>You could choose to ignore banners if you already own an actor's card of the same attribute as the featured SSR. <span class="text2">(See: Actor Management)</span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Ignore pulling for R gacha cards.
				<ul>
				<li>Can be extended to ignoring event-exclusive badges, especially if you don't plan to rank in that event. Badges are purely aesthetic and reward only an extra jukebox track.</li>
				<li>R cards aren't useful in shows outside of events. SSRs and SRs simply have higher stats (and overall have better art). <span class="text2"></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Accept that you cannot rank (Top 0.5% - Top 2%) in every event.
				<ul>
				<li>F2P have limited gems and cannot expect to obtain all of the event SSRs fully bloomed.</li>
				<li>It is possible to obtain the event SSR reward (1.15m Pts) and tier as high as T4 (Top 5%) without spending a single gem.</li>
				</ul>

		<h2>What it's like to rank as F2P</h2>
		<p>This section isn't really a guide, but perhaps it can provide insight for those who haven't touched the top ranks.</p>
		<p>Here's my experience with the first competitive event I attempted to rank in. It was such a fun and enjoyable experience and I would love to rank again in the future. If you haven't ranked before, I would totally recommend trying it out!</p>

Feb 12 and 13 (Day 1 and 5 hours):
HONEYMOON!
OMG STRANGER IS AN AWESOME PLAY EVERYONE LOOKS COOL
CRY FOR OMI
TAICHI CHEERS OMI UP ;;
OMI LOVED NACHI & CRAZY WOLF GANG, AND NOW HIS FELLOW TROUPE MEMBERS
I NEED 4x SSR OMI TO GO WITH MY EXTRA SSR TAICHI
I GOT ALL THE GACHA CARDS I AM MORE THAN READY!!!
My ranking isn't as bad as I expected. 9.9% within the first 5 hours ("day" 1) then 3.0% on second day. Off to a good start!

Feb 14 (Day 2):
@458,810 pts, spent 1 gem (3.0%)
@523,610 spent 9 gems and all kame rewards obtained (1.5%)
@647,869 = 34 gems, all but 1 kame box (1.1%)
Feb 15 (Day 3):
@794,723 Pts = 52 gems, all kame (1.0%)
@915,453 Pts = 70 gems, all kame (0.9-1.0%)
Feb 16 (Day 4):
@1,244,313 Pts = 90 gems, all kame (1.0% all day, 0.9% after getting Omi), 15 tickets, played all day
Feb 17 (Day 5):
@1,493,321 Pts = 103 gems, all kame (0.8% fairly consistently, 0.7% by end of day), played all day

After 5 days into the event, I feel like people are slowing down a bit from a lack of gems. On the 6th day I barely dropped % at all. I am contemplating whether to try to get into the 0.5%. The reward is 50 more gems and an extra copy of the SSR. I will definitely be spending more than 50 gems just to get in, and then more gems everyday just to stay there -- especially during the last two days of the event.
Spending 50 gems at this point will help me reach the bottom of 0.5%, while an additional 100 gems will get me in 0.4%. I might think about doing a sneak attack closer to the end of the event, gauging how much the border grows first during those brutal last days. If it's really that crazy then I'll just focus on staying in Top 1.0% instead.

Feb 18 (Day 6):
@1,744,777 Pts = 122 gems, still have 3 kame boxes from the 1.6m reward. Trying to stay in 0.6% so that I have the opportunity to do a sneak attack on the final day. xD
After 6 days of the event, the Top 0.5% border has already surpassed Campfire Bonds' final Top 0.5% border. At this rate it may even surpass Alex in Wonderland's.
Feb 19 (Day 7):
@1,979,236 = 130 gems, no kame :(

Trying to keep steady in 0.6% close to the bottom of 0.5%, but not surpassing it... oops didn't mean to but did surpass it at one point due to a surprise encore. Now enjoying 0.5% at times :p idk if I should try to get into 0.4 and worry less about dropping out of T1. The gap for that is another ~24 gems worth of points...
I think I have enough bentos for the rest of the event. Unless Matinee keeps showing up.
I missed THREE frickin Encores for 3 SP now. You know what... just pay gems upfront and don't even wait anymore. SERIOUSLY ARRRRGGGHHH SO FRUSTRATING!!! >:(
At this point you wish for the event to end...

Feb 20 (Day 8):
2,205,324 =143 gems + 2 kame reward. Did my attack into 0.4%/top of 0.5% starting today, taking advantage of the rank up LP, and try to maintain 0.5% (expect to drop a bit) on the last day.
A total of 150 gems spent would be ideal since its the 0.5% reward prize :p But it's expected to become hectic in the last day so idk. Hoping not to spend over 200 gems.
Feb 21 (Day 9):
2,375,607 = 143gems, 1 kame

I'm quite ahead now and am not worrying about my rank so much, which is a nice change of pace. Just gotta keep up the rank!
Having some trouble sleeping the last two days tho ;; Hope to get some good sleep after it finally ends.
Have a gap of about 40 gems (150k Pts)

Feb 22 (Day 10, last day):
END ME
I AM FORCING MYSELF TO STAY UP
I AM DYING
I ALSO FELL ASLEEP AND WASTED MY CAPPED LP AND SP from rank up AAAAHHH
(At least I have 5 bentos - enough for the whole day)
The border is catching up faster and faster. Still confident I can stay in 0.5... barely.
Geez I even used 2 SP on a Soiree bc I thought it was a Finale. I am so out of it right now. >< I still pop up on the bottom of 0.4% (even after all these mess ups) but that's bc the point gaps have become much closer, but I better pay attention for the rest of the day.
I haven't done any Encores if it means spending even one gem. This event isn't getting any more of my gems ><
@8:00AM PST: 24 gem gap (0.4) 75k
@3:00PM: 19 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 60k
@5:00PM: 14 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 44k
@7:00PM: 11 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 35k
@8:30PM: 9 gem gap (0.5) 30k
The 0.4% top is 2.603m Pts. The bottom of 0.5% is 2.502m Pts. So there is only a ~100k point difference between 24 players.
0.6% bottom is 2.408m, so another 12 players have a ~100k point difference between them.
Looks like some have given up on 0.5%, but surprise last-minute people are spending gems like crazy and sneaking in 0.5.
Luckily it looks like I'm just barely able to rank up one more time for some much needed SP.
@9:30PM: 12 gem gap (0.5) 36k
Ranked up...
@10:50PM: 6 gem gap 19k while waiting for SP to refill... without that rank up I am forced to spend more gems :o
@11:00PM: 4 gem gap 12k SH***T I NEED TO SPEND
@11:10PM: 6 gem gap 20k. Spent 5 gems. reached 2.6m Pts
@11:25PM: 6 gem gap, 20k. Spent 7 gems
@11:30PM: F*** I THINK IM DED. 2 gems 5k point gap... wut happened
@11:45PM: 10 gem gap 30k. I think I'm ok... but frantically checking ranking every minute.
@11:50PM: 6 gem gap, 18k. Didn't spend anything more or do practices, but have a finale ready just in case.
@11:59PM: I AM EXACTLY ON THE BORDER HOLY MOLY!!! There's a gap of 6k Pts or so to the person below me...
*Waits the full 10 minutes of maintenance dreadfully*
After maint: Right on the border. *Faints* I am never ranking again.

Post-event analysis: the gap was actually 6,842 Pts. A Finale gives 4,952 Pts without bonus Pts so 6,752 Pts with the two event reward cards, one copy of each bloomed ++ gacha card and SSR ++ guest support, so I -might- have been safe either way. ...unless the show was an Encore or if they somehow had five fully bloomed event cards. o.O
		</textarea>
		
		<p>Had the fully bloomed SSR and R card both with lead skill lv 10, an unbloomed SR, and an extra unbloomed SSR I could use for Action shows.</p><br>
		
		<p>SP usage: Did Soirees for 1 SP (level 22 avg). 2 SP for every Finale. 4 SP for Co/Dr Encores, 3 SP for Ac Encores.</p>
		
		<p>Total gems spent to rank in T1: 164. Doesn't -seem- like a lot, but I spent a ton on the gacha so...</p>
		
		<p>Average Pts per day: 261,000. This is almost double my normal amount (135,000 without gacha cards).</p>
		
		<p>Average support usage: 110 times per day.</p><br>
		
		<p>From this event, I learned that clowns really do exist. You thought one fully bloomed card of an actor was enough. No. These so-called "Itarus" try to obtain MULTIPLE FULLY BLOOMED gacha cards, even of the same actor. Their team would be for example one Taichi ++, two Juzas ++, and two Sakyos ++. This is the only way I can explain why some players could get past me in the ranks quicker than I anticipated, because their bonus points reached 2,000+ per show compared to my average of ~1,350.</p>
