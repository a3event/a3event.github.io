	<h2>Theater (Cast Event Play)</h2>

	<p>If the event has a play, event tickets <span class="text2">(troupe tickets for troupe events)</span> will be given from the point rewards and rarely from practice. Base points are 500 per ticket. These points are typically insignificant unless you have a high number of event cards, but every point counts.</p><br>

	<p>Every event card you use gives additional bonus points per ticket. However, unlike shows each unique actor will only count once. You can’t use both the unbloomed & bloomed version of the same card for additional points. Besides that, it doesn't matter where the actors are placed (Supporting Actor D counts too).</p><br>
	
	<img class="ss" src="src/ss_03.png">
	<p><span class="text2">An extra 3,500 Pts!</span></p><br>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Wait until you've obtained the event SR and/or SSR card before using all of your tickets for the maximum amount of bonus points.</p>
	<p>If you're the forgetful type or just want to be safe, use one ticket for the 100% completion badge and save the rest of the tickets for after you have the event SR/SSR. The completion badge will not be available after the event ends.</p><br>
	
	<p>If you have the R gacha card, watch a play with the original cast AFTER the event ends, since you can obtain the "Original cast and costumes" badge anytime.</p>
	
	<p>Only bloomed event cards double as original, so you can't use the unbloomed SR/SSR rewards as original cast.</p>

	<h2>Friend and Guest Supports</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The game encourages you to use different supports throughout the day <span class="text2">(the number 10 indicating friend points will show if you haven't used them yet)</span>, because using the same friend/guest too many times in a day makes them disappear for a while, limiting your support options.</li>
		<li>Who shows up on your support list also seems to be determined by time. If you can't find a specific friend or guest on your list, wait 5-10 minutes before updating again for a chance of the supports changing. But sometimes a friend/guest just won't appear no matter how many times you update.</li>
		<li>If you send a friend request to another player and it stays as pending, then you cannot see or use that player’s cards until the request is either accepted/deleted by the receiver or revoked by you (the sender). This is because the game doesn’t allow you to send a request again to the same player while a current request is pending. <span class="text2">(Using a guest support prompts you to send a friend request)</span></li>
		<li>In a less popular event, it can be more difficult to find event cards.</li>
		<li>Friend and guest supports are limited based on the player's <span class="ytxt">"friend range"</span>; a specific range of players you can see (who can also see you) that is possibly tied to your player ID. This range is only a tiny percentage of the entire player base and likely expands as new players join. This is why many players you see in the rankings will never show up on your support list.
		<ul>
			<li>THEORY: <span class="text2">During The Stranger event, there were around 12,000 players who participated in the event, and ~1,200 players (Top 10%) who received the SSR reward. With two fully bloomed cards with max lead skills, I was receiving 110 usages on average by players daily. I would estimate the range to be about 120 active players (Top 10%) or about 1,200 including all of the inactive/casual players. Let's say the total player base is 120,000 (reasonable guess based on the number of app downloads). Then 1% of all players can see my supports.</span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>It may be advantageous to have friends outside of your <span class="ytxt">"friend range"</span> so that you have a larger pool of supports to choose from. You can find players outside of your range by searching for players in the "Find" section in-game (which refreshes from time to time). You can also add players off-site or have them add you from an alternate account.</li>
		<li>Share your gacha cards if you've pulled them to thank friends and guests who helped you! To set your supporting actors, go to Edit Team, then the Show tab. The lead actors for the first three teams (Comedy, Action, Drama) can be used by friends and guests.</li>

	<h2>General Tips</h2>
	
	<p>(I won't count the first few hours after maintenance as a full event day for simplicity's sake. Events last either 9 or 10 full days.)</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Do all four types of shows (Matinee, Soiree, Finale, Encore) at least once each for the 1st-time gems.</li>
		<li>Know how long the event will last. Some will last 10 full days, others 9 days. Events that are a day shorter can cause some players to be unable to reach their goal in time, particularly the 1.15mil SSR reward.</li>
		<li>The first two to three days of an event is the "Honeymoon" phase, when the event is fresh and exciting and many players will rush to get to the top. The days in the middle of the event (5, 6, 7, 8) slow down as players exhaust their gems and kame boxes. The event will pick up again on the last day, but there will be a notable amount of players who will stop trying after reaching certain milestones (particularly the 1.15mil SSR reward).</li>
		<li>Manage your resources carefully throughout the event. You will be showered with prizes in the first two days, but they can dry up just as quickly. Keep an eye on the upcoming kame boxes and bento you'll receive as you inch closer to reward milestones.</li>
		<li>Don't hoard all of your items until the very last day unless you think you can use them all quickly enough.</li>
		<li>There is some RNG when it comes to getting event shows. For every event practice you do, at least one event show is guaranteed to pop up at some point. The exact percentages are unknown, but it is suspected that Matinees have a slightly higher chance of appearing than Soirees and Finales. Encores are said to appear 25% of the time after doing any of the other three shows.</li>
		<li>You don't <span class="text2">have</span> to do every show. A show that expires stays at the same level the next time you encounter it. The level will only go down (level 1 minimum) if you cancel it.</li>
		<li>Sleeping is highly recommended.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>If you are not ranking:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Patience is key; don’t worry about your ranking in the first 3 or 4 days of an event. Your ranking should stabilize by the 4th or 5th day.</li>
		<li>You shouldn't have an issue with LP running out. <h4>Bento/onigiri:</h4> Use most of them for the Friday/Weekend practices for trophies and coach cards. Consider saving at least one or two of them for the remainder of the event in case, or rely on rank up refills/the ones you'll get from rewards later on.</li>
		<li><h4>Kame buns/boxes:</h4> save for Encores.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>If you plan to rank:</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Be prepared! Set up your teams with optimal link skills in advance and keep in mind other possible link skill combos you could use once you obtain the event SR/SSR. Have trophies and coach cards handy in case you need them.</li>
		<li>Your ranking should stabilize by the 2nd or 3rd full day.</li>
		<li>It's possible to get by with just free LP and not have to spend gems on LP refills. <h4>Bento/onigiri:</h4> save them for the event practices. You can probably use some for the Friday/Weekend practices, but always keep enough on hand for the amount of gems you plan to use.</li>
		<li><h4>Kame buns/boxes:</h4> if you plan to spend gems on refills, they are interchangeable with gems. Otherwise, save them for Encores.</li>
		<li><h4>Borderline Fighting & Safety:</h4> last-day borderline fighting between those close to the borderline and those just underneath it can be hectic and stressful, especially during the <span class="rtxt">Bloodbath</span> (the last two hours before an event ends). Alternatively, you can attempt to rank higher than you normally have to for security. You are considered <span class="gtxt">"safe"</span> when you are in a position that is much higher than the borderline of your goal tier and can stop playing during the <span class="rtxt">Bloodbath</span>. This position varies by tier and by event competitiveness, but generally you should be safe within the "Top 40%" of the tier. The safe range includes players who are trying to get into the tier above them, thus being safe in their own tier. Estimated safe points:
		<ul><li>For T1 (Top 0.5%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 0.1%-0.2%. Those in 0.3% should also be safe due to the larger point gaps in this tier. Players near the bottom of 0.4% and below are <span class="rtxt">not</span> safe and must keep doing shows to keep their rank. Most players will only be fighting over 0.5%.</li>
		<li>For T2 (Top 1%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 0.6%-0.7%. Bottom of 0.8% and below are <span class="rtxt">not</span> safe.</li>
		<li>For T3 (Top 2%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 1.1%-1.3%. Due to the slightly higher competition, players in 1.4% <span class="text2">might</span> be safe. Bottom of 1.5% and below are <span class="rtxt">not</span> safe.</li>
		<li>For T4 (Top 5%), the <span class="gtxt">safe</span> range is 2.1%-4.0%. Due to the much lower competition, players even at 4.5% <span class="text2">might</span> be safe.</li>
		<li>T1 to T3 borders can increase by roughly 100,000 Pts <span class="text2">(Seasonal: 1,000)</span> alone during the <span class="rtxt">Bloodbath</span>.</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	

	<h3>If you don’t have the event cards:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Cancel all Matinees. They are not worth doing without event cards.</li>
	<li>Either do Soirees for 1 SP max (cancel if it will cost 2), or cancel them ALL alongside Matinees. Without event cards, Soirees don’t give as many points compared to Finales and Encores -- plus you won’t be able to do level 19+ Soirees consistently due to the high pass requirements. However, doing Soirees give more chances for Encores to show up. Alternatively, you may consider doing Soirees only after you've obtained the event reward SR/SSR, in which case the Soirees are worth <span class="text2">slightly</span> more with the bonuses.</li>
	<li>Do Finales for 2-4 SP max (usually 2-3 SP).</li>
	<li>Do Encores for 3-6 SP max (usually 4-5 SP).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>If you do have event cards:</h3>

	<ul>
	<li>You may consider doing Matinees for 1 SP if you expect to be low on LP. Keep in mind that 1 SP Soirees are always worth more points than Matinees (a level 50 Matinee for 1 SP ~= level 15 Soiree for 1 SP).</li>
	<li>Soirees are worth doing now due to the extra bonus points received per show. You will also be able to do higher level Soirees (19+). Depending on one's bonus points, they can be on par, if not higher value than even 2 SP Finales.</li>
	<li>Do Soirees for 1 SP max. Cancel Soiree if you can’t do it for 1 SP.</li>
	<li>Do Finales for 2 SP max. (3 SP is not ideal)</li>
	<li>Do Encores for 3-4 SP max.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Ranking Strategies</h2>

	<p>There are various ways to play the events depending on the player's available playtime, play-style, and amount of gems on hand. Here are some strategies that can be switched back and forth and even combined.</p>

	<div class="box2">
	<h3>The “Play whenever I want to" strategy</h3>

	<td class="gtxt">Low</td>

	<td>Tiers to aim for:</td>

	</tr><tr>
	<td>F2P-Friendly:</td>
	<td class="gtxt">Yes</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td>Beginner-Friendly:</td>
	<td class="gtxt">Yes</td>
	</tr></table>
	
	<br>
	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Just chill.</p><br>
	
	<p>A relaxing way to play the events. Casual players are just as important in helping the Top 10% rank. <span class="text2">Thanks guys!</span><p><br>
	
	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Use up all of your free items. Bento/onigiri will help you rank up for a free refill. Kame buns/boxes will be more valuable than ever.</p>
	<p>Log in on at least four different days of the event to get an extra kame box.</p>
	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>Aiming for the SR reward (700k Pts) is a reasonable goal and will put you in the Top 20%. The SSR reward is out of reach, however.</p>
	
	<table class="pros"><tr>
	<td width="40%">
	<h4 class="gtxt">Pros</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>No stress.</li>
	<li>No issues with LP.</li>

	</ul>
	</td><td width="40%">
	<h4 class="rtxt">Cons</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Less rewards than higher ranking players.</li>
	<li>Less training items & rank ups if you don't use up all of your LP/bento.</li>
	</ul>
	</td></tr></table>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="box2">
	<h3>The “Play every 1 hour and 40 minutes” strategy</h3>
	
	<table class="evt evt2"><tr>
	<td>Stress level:</td>
	<td class="ytxt">Average</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td>Tiers to aim for:</td>

	<td>F2P-Friendly:</td>
	<td class="gtxt">Yes</td>
	</tr><tr>
	<td>Beginner-Friendly:</td>
	<td class="gtxt">Yes</td>
	</tr></table>

	<br>
	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward, with minimal gems.</p><br>
	
	<p>Relies on using your natural SP (and LP) refills.</p>
	<p>You have 5 SP max (overfills to 10 max). Each SP takes 20 minutes to regenerate. From 0 SP at a timer of 19:59, it takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to completely refill all SP.</p>
	<p>Use up as much free SP as possible every time you play. If you need one more SP for a Finale, you can wait for it to regen and maximize your refill timer (that is, if a surprise Encore doesn't show up). If you only have 1 SP remaining and need 3 for a Finale, it is recommended to just let it expire (in this case the timer for full SP will be 20 mins shorter).</p>
	<p>App notifications can be turned on to tell you when your SP is full.</p><br>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>I would shorten the wait time to 1 hour and 30 minutes max, so that there are still 10 minutes to do event practices in case Matinees keep showing up (and you won't "waste" the timer for the next SP regen).</p>
	<p>Set an alarm or write down the time for when you should check the app again. And no need to stress if you come back to a full SP bar.</p>
	<p>While you are waiting for SP to regen, keep your LP at or under 30 less than the maximum cap (170/200 for Rank 100+). Waiting 1h and 30m means your LP will regen by 30, enough for two event practices.</p>

	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>It's possible to obtain the SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) after playing constantly for 9 days, and still get 8 hours of sleep.</p>

	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward, but quicker.</p><br>
	
	<p>An optimization strategy for when you don't have the gacha cards.</p>
	<p>Once you have enough strong cards, 2 SP Finales of the same attribute as the gacha SSRs/SRs can be done somewhat consistently. The best supports from friends and guests can save you an SP, but sometimes they just won’t appear, even after updating the list.</p><br>

	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>Do as many 2 SP Finales as you can. They give out the second most points per SP after 3-4 SP Encores.</p>
	<p>Cancel all Matinees and Soirees.</p>
	<p>Have at least 1 SP on hand before doing more practices.</p>
	<p>If it will cost 3 SP to do a Finale, let the timer on them run out (do not cancel). This means you’re going to be checking the app again after waiting 20+ minutes.</p>
	<p>The next time you get a show, it "refreshes" and may have a different attribute. Your support list may also change <span class="text2">(See: <a href="#friend" target="_self">Friend and Guest Supports</a>)</span>. This means you may be able to do the next Finale for 2 SP.</p>
	<p>Only do Finales for 3 SP if your SP is full or close to being refilled.</p>
	
	<h4>VARIATION:</h4>
	<p>You can also do 1 SP Soirees to have more chances of Encores appearing. If you had a full 5/5 SP bar and the Encore needs 4 SP, you can spend all of your SP at once!</p>
	
	<h4>ZERO GEMS:</h4>
	<p>It's possible to obtain the SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) after playing constantly for 8 days, and still get 8 hours of sleep.</p>
	<p>Once you've run out of kame boxes, you might have to ignore Encores or cancel them until you can do them for 3 SP (i.e. cancel at level 10 and do them at level 9).</p>

	<h4>GOAL:</h4>
	<p>Rank, with gacha cards.</p><br>

	<p>So you went all-out on the banner. You have all three of the event cards bloomed once, or perhaps two of them fully bloomed.</p>
	<p>Your overpowered cards will help you rank easier due to:
	<ul>
		<li>Additional bonus points per show (they add up quickly)</li>
		<li>Less SP to do shows</li>
		<li>Less gems spent on SP refills compared to those without event cards (besides the amount you blew on the banner).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Keep doing event practices and spend gems on SP refills.</p>
	<p>You could either rush to the top and slow down after getting the event SSR, or play frequently everyday (the SSR can be achieved more reasonably by the 4th full day).</p><br>
	
	<h4>VARIATION:</h4>
	<p>Only spend gems on the gacha, and little to none for SP refills. Depending on how competitive the event is, T3 is possible with just one fully bloomed card. But unless you lucked out and have a team of five fully bloomed gacha cards, you'll likely be spending additional gems on top of the gacha for T1/T2.</p>
	
	<h4>OPTIMIZATION:</h4>
	<p>If you save all of your bento/onigiri for only the event practices, then you can avoid spending any additional gems on LP refills.</p>

	<p>Is using your gems for SP refills better value than pulling on the gacha banner?</p>

		<li>Will the gacha SSR/SR also be useful in future events? <span class="text2">(See: <a href="#roster" target="_self">Actor Management</a>)</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>If not, then you can ignore the gacha altogether.</p>

	<p>Generally, spending gems on refills is better value since it is a more guaranteed way to rank highly. Gacha is random and isn't guaranteed to give you the event cards.</p><br>

	<h2>Rookie Mistakes</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Accidentally pressing “Start Show” instead of “Cancel” on a Matinee. There is no confirmation to start a show if you have enough SP. <span class="text2">(So many Matinees in a row...)</span></li>
	<li>Accidentally pressing “Start Show” with the wrong boost amount. Always make sure you will <span class="rtxt">pass</span> a show before confirming! <span class="text2">(Ended up wasting an extra SP to pass the show)</span></li>
	<li>Being shy of a couple hundred points to passing a Finale or Encore with the ideal SP amount. Figuring out which cards to train at the last minute isn’t the greatest idea. Be prepared if you want to rank! <span class="text2">(See: <a href="#general" target="_self">General Tips</a>) (I finished training a card I needed, panicked with seconds on the clock left -- misclicking the wrong boost -- wasting an SP, and then the show expired... yeah...)</span></li>
	<li>Waiting for one SP to regenerate and then forgetting to check the app again in time, coming back to an expired timer. It’s handy to write down the time or set an alarm, as short as the timers are, or leave the app idle if it’s only a couple of minutes. <span class="text2">(Still do this from time to time D:)</span></li>
	<li>Staying up late, then falling asleep in the middle of an event practice or while waiting for SP. <span class="text2">(Yup)</span></li>
	</ul>

	</div>
	
	
	
	<div class="box">
	
	<h2>Trivia</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In the case of a tie right at the borderline, the number of spots in that tier will temporarily increase for each player with the same amount of points, but will go back to normal as soon as the tie has been broken or the borderline has been overtaken.</li>
		<li>For Troupe events, the maximum bonus points that can be obtained per show is 2,550 Pts with five fully bloomed SSRs plus a fully bloomed SSR support (425 Pts each).</li>
		<li>For Seasonal events, the max bonus points is 24 Pts (scale to 2,400). These events are a little easier to obtain max bonus points for since ++ SRs give the same bonus points as ++ SSRs. An event with multiple SSRs/SRs (i.e. Say I Do! / Hot Springs) and some luck makes this possible without having a bottomless wallet.</li>

		<h2>Gem Management Tips</h2>
		<p>After reaching Rank 100+ with your legendary actor management skills, you've reached the endgame of A3! <span class="text2">where we all suffer in endless event hell</span> -- or as I like to call it, a "gem management" game. These shiny red diamonds are the limited resource for pulling the gacha and for ranking, besides shelling out for premium gems with real money.</p><br>
		
		<img class="ss" src="src/ss_01.png">
		<p>Free gems have little restrictions. The only things exclusive to premium gems are the infrequent 1-time "Special Actor Tryouts" that guarantee you a SSR, the "Start Dash Tryouts" <span class="text2">(such as the one for new players)</span> that allows you to choose a card of your liking, and the daily pull on Premium Tryouts for a discount. None of these are a necessity to progress.</p>
		<p>Saving gems takes willpower, but it's not impossible!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't pull on every banner.
				<ul>
				<li>You could ignore banners that don't have an event attached to them, as there is currently no guaranteed "pity system" implemented.</li>
				<li>Choose only a few actors ("best boys") to pull for. You could even ignore SRs and pull only for the SSRs. <span class="text2">I ignore the featured SR of one of my best boys if I don't care for the featured SSR(s).</span></li>
				<li>You could ignore a banner if you already own an actor's SSR card of the same attribute as the featured SSR. <span class="text2">(See: <a href="#roster" target="_self">Actor Management</a>)</span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Don't pull just for R gacha cards (unless you're ranking in that event).
				<ul>
				<li>Event-exclusive badges that require the R card are purely aesthetic and reward only an extra jukebox track.</li>
				<li>Outside of events, R cards aren't useful in shows in the long run. Trained SSR and SR cards have higher stats <span class="text2">(and overall have better art)</span>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Don't attempt to rank (Top 0.5% - Top 2%) in every event.
				<ul>
				<li>F2P have limited gems and cannot expect to obtain all of the event SSRs fully bloomed while still having gems left for the gacha. You do not <span class="text2">need</span> fully bloomed SSRs.</li>
				<li>It's possible to obtain the event SSR reward (1.15mil Pts) and tier as high as T4 (Top 5%) without spending a single gem. Keep the amount of gems spent minimal for events if you're not ranking (0-20 gems).</li>
				<li>Rank badges are for the "Itarus" and have no purpose outside of aesthetics and bragging rights. They reward 10 Premium Tokens (5 more than the other tiers) which aren't worth the additional gems spent to obtain them. <span class="text2">(You can only show off a maximum of two badges on your profile anyway...)</span></li>

		<h2>About Premium Tokens</h2>
		<p>Premium tokens are a currency comparable to that of gems. They are considered to be worth more than a single pull (15 gems) but aren't nearly worth more than one multi-pull (145 gems).</p>
		<p>They are currently obtainable from ranking up and from event rewards.</p>
		<p>They can only be used for Premium Tryouts and the upcoming Birthday Tryouts <span class="text2">(predicted to start in June 2020)</span>.</p>
		<p>5 tokens give a single pull equivalent to the last pull of a multi-pull (guaranteed SR or higher).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Beginners should pull on a banner several times and/or use their tokens for some much-needed SRs and SSRs. Once you have a decent amount of initial cards and no longer  rely on R cards, save your remaining tokens for the Birthday Tryouts.</li>

		<p>General tips:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Before starting an offer, check the Play Store for ratings and reviews and search for the app to see if the offer has been completed before.</li>
			<li>Don't make careless in-app purchases or you might end up spending more than what the reward is worth. If you are strictly F2P, ignore the offers that require you to purchase something. Some offers can be completed for free; all you need is patience.</li>
			<li>Don't start an offer that will take days or weeks to complete while an A3! event is going on. Keep in mind that offers are time-limited and juggling between one and the event can be stressful.</li>

			<h2>Actor Management Tips</h2>
			<p>These tips mainly apply for Part 1 <span class="text2">(A3!'s first year)</span>, when not many cards have been released yet and there are less link skill combos.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The ideal roster would be to have three SSRs of each actor covering all three attributes: one for Comedy, one for Action, and one for Drama.
				<li>If an SSR for that actor isn't available for the player to use, SRs are the next strongest cards that can be used in place of SSRs. Fully bloomed, fully trained SRs are on par with unbloomed, untrained SSRs.</li>
				<li>If neither an SSR nor SR of an actor is available, R cards are a last resort option. Training them is cheap, but they aren't useful in the long run.
				<ul>
					<li>A F2P exception for R cards is the R Drama Hisoka card. There will not be any event reward SSR/SR Hisoka cards in Part 1.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Owning more than one SSR of the same +Attribute of the same actor is not necessary and just for collecting purposes. <span class="text2">(i.e. if you own the Sardines Yuki SSR which is +Action, you can ignore banners featuring a SSR +Action Yuki. This applies even more if your SSR is bloomed at least once)</span>. Keep in mind that future cards have "powercreep" and have higher stat totals than the initial cards, especially their strongest attribute. Whether these stronger cards are worth pulling for is up to the player.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Although you don't <span class="text2">need</span> a full team of fully bloomed SSRs all of the same attribute to pass shows for minimal SP, it's still useful to have a wide variety of cards. Event reward cards are especially important to get for F2P.</p>

			<h3>Using the table:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Attribute: There are three types of shows -- Comedy (Co), Action (Ac), and Drama (Dr).</li>
				<li>Stats: Every card has a strong stat, a good stat, and a weak stat.</li>
				<li>Forte [⇧ ⇧ ⇧]: The actor's best attribute. You will never find a card of the actor that has this attribute as their weak stat.</li>
				<li>Weak stat [<span class="downarrow">▼</span>]: The weakest stat on that card.</li>
				<li>Best [#]: This actor's overall best attribute for link skill combinations, and the total number of link skills they have.</li>
				<li>F2P: How F2P-Friendly this actor's cards are in Part 1. Factors considered are the ratio of gacha-only to event reward cards, rarity of F2P cards, and if the actor's F2P cards help with their best link skills.</li>
				<li><span class="gacha_ssr">Gacha:</span> <span class="rtxt">Not F2P-Friendly.</span> Currently, can only be obtained from pulling the gacha banner. These cards are limited.</li>
				<li><span class="free_ssr">Event:</span> <span class="gtxt">Accessible to F2P.</span> These cards are given out as event prizes and are limited.</li>
				<li><span class="free_sr">Initial:</span> <span class="gtxt">Accessible to F2P.</span> These cards are not limited and always have a chance of being pulled.</li>
				<li><i>Future</i>: These cards are not yet available on the EN server. Upcoming tryouts and events can be predicted based on the past JP scouts and events.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>All R cards are unlisted as they are typically irrelevant.</p>
			<p>Certain SR <span class="gacha_sr">gacha</span> cards are unlisted if there are two or more <span class="free_sr">F2P-accessible</span> variants (initial and event SSRs/SRs). (i.e. Tsuzuru's "Sakura Diary" card is +Ac SR, but he has a more accessible initial +Ac SSR and an upcoming event +Ac SSR)</p>
			<p>There are additional unlisted cards such as collab cards and cards outside of regular banners and events. It is unknown if these cards will be available in the EN server.</p>

		<h4>Initial SSRs ranked from best to worst:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1. <div class="img_co" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Muku, since he has no other +Co cards in Part 1 and has 4 Comedy link skill combos.</li>
			<li>2. <div class="img_co" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Tenma. Like Muku, this is his only +Co card. <span class="text2">Although Citron also has only one +Co card, Comedy is his forte, while Tenma's other cards usually have Comedy as its weak stat.</span> He has 2 Comedy link skill combos, including the Summer troupe skill.</li>
			<li>3. <div class="img_ac" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Sakuya and <div class="img_co" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Hisoka simply because they lack F2P-accessible cards.</li>
			<li>4. Any other initial SSR that isn't listed (all good cards).</li>
			<li>5. <div class="img_ac" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Misumi is just decent. He has one Action link skill, but it is exclusive. Action is his forte so it isn't as important to have his +Ac card either.
			<li>6. <div class="img_dr" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Yuki, since he has one of the worst link skills for his strong attribute. This card is instead used for its good stat, Comedy, as +Co Yuki cards are rare. <span class="text2">Yuki's other cards usually have Comedy as its weak stat.</span></li>
			<li>7. <div class="img_co" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Banri and <div class="img_dr" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Taichi are below average. Both have only one 12% link skill for their strong stat, but they can at least combine with their respective troupe link skills.</li>
	<li>8. <div class="img_ac" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Kazunari, <div class="img_dr" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Juza, and <div class="img_ac" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div>Homare, since they have the worst link skills for their strong stat. These cards are nothing special and can be replaced with any other card of that actor.</li>

			<h2>Analysis</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The number of players who reach the event SSR milestone (1.15mil) increases dramatically on the last day. <span class="text2">Only ~0.1% of players have the event SSR in the first two days of an event.</span></li>
				<li>Reaching the event SR milestone (700k Pts) currently guarantees a placement in the Top 20%.</li>
				<li>The events considered <span class="rtxt">highly</span> competitive so far are: "Stranger" [4] and "Wonderland" [1], with borders comparable to each other taking event duration and recency into account, and then "Mystery" [6] and "Hot Springs" [5] slightly behind.</li>
				<li>The T2 (1%) border for "The Stranger" is unusually higher than average.</li>
				<li>The events considered <span class="gtxt">less</span> competitive so far are: "Campfire Bonds" [3] (by far), followed by "The Great Sardine Search" [2]. During the first seasonal event, there were a notable lack of supports compared to other events. <span class="text2">The bloomed Citron card is currently the rarest event card.</span></li>
				<li>Over time, T3 (2.0%) and T6 (20%) have slightly higher borderlines on average despite events being a day shorter. The other tiers have stayed relatively the same.</li>
				<li>T4 (Top 5.0%) is the least competitive tier out of the first five tiers. T4 (5%) and T5 (10%) mostly consist of players who have stopped playing shortly after reaching the 1.15mil milestone.</li>
				<li>The number of players participating in events has decreased over time. An estimated number of players who start on the 1st day of an event is about 50-60% of the final participation total <span class="text2">(~6,400 players played within the 1st full day of the "Mystery" event [6])</span>. </li>

		<h2>About link skills</h2>
		
		<p>A maximum of six actors can activate any number of link skills (five from your roster plus one guest).</p>
		<p>Besides relying on boosted stats from event cards, it's important to use unique actors and combinations to pass shows using minimal SP.</p><br>
		
		<p>Link skills that can be combined/overlapped with other skills are all important to cover due to the limited actor slots. The total boost can reach as high as 72%.</p>
		<p>Link skills that are exclusive to just those actors are arguably less important to cover as they cannot be combined with other link skills, and may be ignored in favor of other cards and combos depending on the player's roster.</p><br>
		
		<p>The following link skills are currently exclusive (maximum boost of 48% with six actors):</p>
		<ul>
			<li><div class="img_ac" style="width: 20px; 
	display: inline-block;"></div> Muku + Misumi + Hisoka (24%) and <div class="img_ac" style="width: 20px;

		<h2>What it's like to rank as F2P</h2>
		<p>This section isn't really a guide, but perhaps it can provide insight for those who haven't touched the top ranks.</p>
		<p>Here's my experience with the first competitive event I attempted to rank in. It was such a fun and enjoyable experience and I would love to rank again in the future. If you haven't ranked before, I would totally recommend trying it out!</p>
		<p>Contains story spoilers for "The Stranger".</p>

Feb 12 and 13 (Day 1 and 5 hours):
HONEYMOON!
OMG STRANGER IS AN AWESOME PLAY EVERYONE LOOKS COOL
CRY FOR OMI
TAICHI CHEERS OMI UP
OMI LOVED NACHI & CRAZY WOLF GANG, AND NOW HIS FELLOW TROUPE MEMBERS
I NEED 4x SSR OMI TO GO WITH MY EXTRA SSR TAICHI
I GOT ALL THE GACHA CARDS I AM MORE THAN READY!!!
My ranking isn't as bad as I expected. 9.9% within the first 5 hours then 3.0% on second day. Off to a good start!

Feb 14 (Day 2):
@458,810 pts, spent 1 gem (3.0%)
@523,610 = 9 gems total and all kame rewards obtained (1.5%)
@647,869 = 34 gems total, all but 1 kame box (1.1%)
Feb 15 (Day 3):
@794,723 Pts = 52 gems total, all kame (1.0%)
@915,453 Pts = 70 gems total, all kame (0.9-1.0%)
Feb 16 (Day 4):
@1,244,313 Pts = 90 gems total, all kame (1.0% all day, 0.9% after getting Omi), 15 tickets, played all day
Feb 17 (Day 5):
@1,493,321 Pts = 103 gems total, all kame (0.8% fairly consistently, 0.7% by end of day), played all day

After 5 days into the event, I feel like people are slowing down a bit from a lack of gems. On the 6th day I barely dropped % at all. I am contemplating whether to try to get into the 0.5%.
Spending 50 gems at this point will help me reach the bottom of 0.5%, while 100 more gems will get me in 0.4%. I might think about doing a sneak attack closer to the end of the event, depending on how much the border grows first during those brutal last days. If it's really that crazy then I'll just focus on staying in Top 1.0% instead.

Feb 18 (Day 6):
@1,744,777 Pts = 122 gems total (0.6%), still have 3 kame boxes from the 1.6m reward. Trying to stay in 0.6% so that I have the opportunity to do a sneak attack on the final day. xD
After 6 days of the event, the Top 0.5% border has already surpassed Campfire Bonds' final Top 0.5% border. At this rate it may even surpass Alex in Wonderland's.
Feb 19 (Day 7):
@1,979,236 = 130 gems total, no kame :( (0.5%)

Trying to keep steady in 0.6% close to the bottom of 0.5%, but not surpassing it... oops didn't mean to but did surpass it at one point due to a surprise encore. Now enjoying 0.5% at times :p Maybe I should try to get into 0.4 and worry less about dropping out of T1. The gap for that is another ~24 gems worth of points...
I think I have enough bento for the rest of the event. Unless Matinee keeps showing up.
At this point you wish for the event to end...

Feb 20 (Day 8):
@2,205,324 = 143 gems total + 2 kame reward. (0.4%) Did my attack into 0.4%/top of 0.5% starting today, taking advantage of the rank up LP, and try to maintain 0.5% (expect to drop a bit) on the last day.
A total of 150 gems spent would be ideal since its the 0.5% reward prize :p But it's expected to become hectic in the last day so... Hoping not to spend over 200 gems.
Feb 21 (Day 9):
@2,375,607 = 143 gems total, 1 kame (0.4%)

I'm quite ahead now and am not worrying about my rank so much, which is a nice change of pace. Just gotta keep up the rank!
Having some trouble sleeping the last two days tho :( Hope to get some good sleep after it finally ends.
Have a gap of about 40 gems (150k Pts) to 0.5% border.

Feb 22 (Day 10, last day):
END ME
I AM FORCING MYSELF TO STAY UP
I AM DYING
I ALSO FELL ASLEEP AND WASTED MY CAPPED LP AND SP from rank up AAAAHHH
(At least I have 5 bento - enough for the whole day)
The border is catching up faster and faster. Still confident I can stay in 0.5... barely.
I even used 2 SP on a Soiree bc I thought it was a Finale. I am so out of it right now. I still pop up on the bottom of 0.4% (even after all these mess ups) but that's bc the point gaps have become much closer, but I better pay attention for the rest of the day.
I haven't done any Encores if it means spending even one gem. This event isn't getting any more of my gems :(
@8:00AM PST: 24 gem gap (0.4) 75k
@3:00PM: 19 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 60k
@5:00PM: 14 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 44k
@7:00PM: 11 gem gap (0.5/0.4) 35k
@8:30PM: 9 gem gap (0.5) 30k
The 0.4% top is 2.603m Pts. The bottom of 0.5% is 2.502m Pts. So there is only a ~100k point difference between 24 players.
0.6% bottom is 2.408m, so another 12 players have a ~100k point difference between them.
Looks like some have given up on 0.5%, but surprise last-minute people are spending gems like crazy and sneaking in 0.5.
Luckily it looks like I'm just barely able to rank up one more time for some much needed SP.
@9:30PM: 12 gem gap (0.5) 36k
Ranked up...
@10:50PM: 6 gem gap 19k while waiting for SP to refill... without that rank up I am forced to spend more gems :o
@11:00PM PST: 4 gem gap 12k !@#$% I NEED TO SPEND
@11:10PM: 6 gem gap 20k. Spent 5 gems. reached 2.6m Pts
@11:25PM: 6 gem gap, 20k. Spent 7 gems
@11:30PM: !@#$% I THINK IM DED. 2 gem gap 5k... wut happened
@11:45PM: 10 gem gap 30k. I think I'm ok... but frantically checking ranking every minute.
@11:50PM: 6 gem gap, 18k. Didn't spend anything more or do practices, but have a finale ready just in case.
@11:59PM: I AM EXACTLY ON THE BORDER !@#$%!@#$%!!! The person below is about 6k pts away...?!
*Waits the full 10 minutes of maintenance dreadfully*
After maint: 4x SSR Omi. *Faints* Free at last...

Post-event analysis: the gap between me and the player below was actually 6,842 Pts. A Finale gives a base 4,952 Pts so 6,752 Pts with the two event reward cards, one copy of each fully bloomed ++ gacha card and SSR ++ guest support, so I -might- have been safe either way. ...unless they got an Encore or if they had 4+ fully bloomed event cards. o.O

		<p><span class="text2">Why be on the front page when all you need is the borderline?</span></p><br>
		
		<p>Had the fully bloomed SSR and R event cards both with lead skill lv 10, an unbloomed SR, and an extra unbloomed SSR I could use for Action shows.</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>SP usage: Soirees - 1 SP (range: level 18 to 24. level 21/22 avg). Finales - 2 SP. Encores - 4 SP for Co/Dr, 3 SP for Ac.</li>
		<li>Total gems spent to rank in T1: 164. <span class="text2">Doesn't seem like a lot, but I played everyday and spent a ton on the gacha so...</span></li>
		<li>If I didn't spend those 164 gems, I would have been in T3 (2%).</li>
		<li>I didn't spend any gems to refill LP.</li>
		<li>Average Pts per day: 261,000. This is almost double my normal amount (135,000 without gacha cards or gems). My event cards gave me about 1.5x the normal amount of points, and the rest came from additional kame boxes/bento <a href="#prizes" target="_self">past 1.5mil</a>.</li>
		<li>Average support usage: 110 times per day.</li>
		<li>I did get (some) sleep, but stayed up for the Bloodbath. I was playing constantly during the last hour <span class="text2">(though I slowed down in the last 15 minutes when I probably shouldn't have).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>From this event, I learned that "clowns" really do exist. You thought one fully bloomed card of an actor was enough. No. These "Itarus" go for MULTIPLE FULLY BLOOMED gacha cards, even of the same actor. Their team would be for example one Taichi ++, two Juzas ++, and two Sakyos ++. Unless they were extremely lucky with getting constant Encores, this is the only way I can explain why some players could get past me in the ranks quicker than I had anticipated, because their bonus points reached 2,000+ per show compared to my average of ~1,350.</p>

		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I started playing in October of 2019 and wanted to help make information about A3! more accessible to the EN community. When I played my first event, it was initially new and exciting <span class="text2">(Omg shows can pop up in the middle of practice?!)</span>. But as days went by, I soon felt exhausted and worried about not reaching the SSR reward in time. I panicked-trained when I was under a couple hundred points or so to passing a show and didn't want to "overboost", didn't know which link skills might give me enough points to pass, and wasted so many gems just to get 1.15mil Pts.</p>
		<p>I am thankful to the Subreddit, the Wiki, and those who came from the JP version giving tips on how to play the game more efficiently.</p>
		<p>I'd be happy if this guide helped even a little. Perhaps it can spice up the competition a bit. ;) <span class="text2">Please go easy on me during Summer's 3rd play.</span></p><br>
