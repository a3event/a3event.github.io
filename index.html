	Tiers

	T1 (Top 0.5%)
	T2 (Top 1.0%)
	T3 (Top 2.0%) --- cutoff for 2 copies of SSR
	T4 (Top 5.0%)
	T5 (Top 10.0%) --- cutoff for 1 copy of SSR
	T6 (Top 20.0%) --- cutoff for 2 copies of SR
	T7 (Top 30.0%)
	T8 (Top 40.0%) --- cutoff for 1 copy of SR
	T9 (Top 50.0%)
	T10 (Top 60.0%)
	T11 (Top 80.0%)
	T12 (Top 100.0%)

	T1 and T2 are very competitive and are mainly for bragging rights as they reward exclusive badges. It is not recommended to aim for these tiers without bloomed event gacha cards and/or hundreds of gems on hand.
	The most important tiers are T3 (2%) and T5 (10%), as they are the minimum tiers that reward at least one copy of the event SSR at the end of the event.
	T6 (20%) is still a decent tier to be in as you can fully bloom your event SR which can become as strong as unbloomed SSRs.
	Tiers below T6 are intended for beginners, casual players, and those uninterested in tiering.

	Without any event cards and minimal gem usage, an active player can expect to rank within T4 to T6 (5%-20%) during a competitive event, and in a less competitive event as high as T3 (2%).

	Free Gems from Events

	[During Events]
	20 gems from doing the four shows (Matinee, Soiree, Finale, Encore) for the 1st time.
	50 gems from fully completing all event practices (3 missions, 100% flair, watch play once).
	40-50 gems on average from rewards (max of 60 gems @1.5m Pts).
	11 gems from the event-exclusive story.
	1-4 gems from backstories of free N/R event cards (varies per event).
	0-11 gems from backstories of event gacha cards and SR/SSR reward cards (varies per event)
	= ~130-140 gems during event, excluding dailies

	[After Events]
	60 gems for ranking in T4 to T6 (5%-20%) on average (varies per player; max of 150 gems @T1).
	5 gems for doing a show for the 1st time after being permanently added to the list of shows (if the event was a main troupe play)
	= ~190-205 gems per event

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	General Tips

	Patience is key. Don’t worry about your ranking in the first three days of each event; many players will rush to get to the top. Some will end up not having enough gems to keep their rank. By day 4, your ranking should stabilize. Days 5 to 9 slow down somewhat as players have exhausted their gems and kame boxes. There will be another rush during the last two days (10th and 11th) of each event, but there will be a notable amount of players who will stop trying after reaching certain milestones (particularly the 1.15mil SSR reward).

	If you don’t have the event cards:

	Avoid spending gems to refill LP; use onigiri, bentos, and refills from ranking up (and natural regen from sleep/life). If you are not planning to use a lot of gems, you should not have an issue with LP.
	Cancel all Matinees (after doing it once for the gems). They are not worth doing without event cards.
	You may consider cancelling all Soirees as well. Without event cards they don’t give as many points compared to Finales and Encores, plus you won’t be able to do level 19+ Soirees due to the high pass requirements. If you manage to obtain the 1.15mil reward before the end of the event and can use both event SSR+SR rewards in your shows, then Soirees can be done then.
	Do Finales for 2-4 SP max (usually 3 SP).
	Do Encores for 3-6 SP max (usually 5 SP).

	If you do have event cards:

	You may consider doing Matinees for 1 SP if you expect to be low on LP.
	Soirees are worth it now due to the extra bonus points. Do Soirees for 1 SP only. Cancel Soiree if you can’t do it for 1 SP.
	Do Finales for 2-3 SP max (usually 2 SP, 3 SP is not ideal).
	Do Encores for 3-4 SP max (usually 4 SP).

	A level 50 Matinee (1 SP) is worth about the same as a level 15 Soiree (1 SP). However the Matinee has a higher pass requirement. If you can fulfill this high requirement for 1 SP, then you are also able to do the higher level Soirees (18+) that are worth more points.

	At a high level (24+), 1 SP Soirees can be worth more than 2 SP Finales if they can be done with most to all of the event cards, but you'll rarely be able to do them so it’s not significant.

	<div class="box">

	Ranking Strategies

	These strategies are based on personal experience and theorycrafting. They can be switched back and forth depending on one’s gems and playtime. Feel free to try them and modify as you see fit.

	The “Play every 1 hour and 30 minutes” strategy

	Stress level: Low (if getting sleep)
	Tiers to aim for: T4-T6 (Top 5%-20%)
	F2P: Yes

	Straightforward. Let SP refill naturally.
	Each SP takes 20 minutes to regenerate. You have 5 max SP. From 0 SP at a timer of 19:59, it takes 1 hour and 40 minutes to completely refill SP.

	1 hour and 30 minutes is the maximum amount of time recommended to wait for, so that you still have the last 10 minutes to do event practices (4/5 SP with a timer under 10 minutes) in case Matinees keep showing up.
	Optimally, you should probably set an alarm or write down the time for when you should check the app again.

	Not sleeping is not recommended.

	Pros
	Little to no issues with LP.
	Optimal for all players.
	Low stress compared to some other strategies.
	Cons
	Cannot be optimized all the time due to real life responsibilities.

	The “I hate Matinees” strategy

	Similar to the “play every hour and 30 minutes”

	Besides 1st-time clears, always cancel Matinee.
	Do Soirees and Finales.



	The “Refresh shows (Finale only)” strategy

	Difficulty: Medium
	Stress level: High
	Tiers to aim for: T3-T5 (Top 2%-10%)
	F2P: Yes

	A decent strategy for those without event cards.
	Sometimes the best cards from friends and guests just won’t appear, no matter how many times you update.

	Your goal is to do as many Finales for 2 SP only to maximize points.
	Always cancel Matinee. You may also want to cancel Soirees.
	However, do not cancel Finales. Let the timer on them run out. This means you’re going to be checking the game every 20 minutes at times.
	Only do Finales for 3 SP if your SP is full or close to being refilled.

	Can be changed back and forth with the other strats depending on your LP/luck.

	Cons
	You will run out of LP faster.
	Stressful to play the game constantly. Not recommended for long periods of time.

	The “Just for best boy” strategy

	Difficulty: Easy
	Stress level: Low
	Tiers to aim for: T1-T3 (Top 0.5%-2%)
	F2P: Not F2P-friendly

	Just spend your gems on SP refills.
	It is recommended to have at least two bloomed event cards and some good friend supports to use.

	You may consider doing any show that comes your way -- even the Matinees -- as you might not have enough LP from just the bentos, onigiri, and free refills from rank ups.
	You may or may not spend gems to refill LP as well. Personally, I would avoid doing so.

	Cons
	Your poor gems...

	The “No Gacha” strategy (theory)

	Difficulty: Medium
	Stress level: Medium
	Tiers to aim for: T1-T3 (Top 0.5%-2%)
	F2P: Not recommended for beginners

	Is pulling on the gacha banner for the bonus points better value than using your gems for refills only?

	Two questions to ask yourself:
	Are the boys featured on the banner your best boys?
	Will the banner SSR also be useful in future events? (Likely so if you don’t already own an SSR of the featured boy)
	If not, then you might want to consider ignoring the gacha altogether.

	I haven’t tried this strategy before, but in theory it should be effective (so long as you have the gems to spare and enough trained actors), being a more guaranteed way of ranking highly. On the other hand, gacha is random and you may never even pull the event cards.

	Pros
	This strat combined with the standard “1 hour and 30 minutes” should allow a player to compete with the top percentages without going overboard on gem spending.
	Not reliant on gacha. Guaranteed way to obtain lots of points, so long as there are enough gems.
	Cons
	Not a good strategy for beginners. You will waste a TON of gems without team optimization.
	Doesn’t feel rewarding, as you will get the minimal amount of points per gem spent. You’ll have to do more shows to get the same amount of points compared to those with event bonuses.

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	Average Pts without event cards

	I get about 2,900 Pts/SP on average with an average of 850 bonus points per show, and after obtaining the SR and SSR rewards, can average even 3,000+ Pts/SP with 1000 bonus points. Not including the guest support.
	A player with two fully bloomed cards can earn about double the amount of Pts/SP vs. a player without any event cards.

	Let’s say that the “No Gacha” player will also rush to obtain the event SSR as soon as possible. Then the free cards technically cancel each other out? On second thought… unless the players with event cards are able to use all of them as much as possible due to their overpowered bloomed cards, while the “No Gacha” player may not always be able to use the unbloomed cards to pass shows.

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	Friend and Guest Supports

	Use the minimal card needed to pass the show with the minimal SP. Don’t use a friend/guest too many times in a day or they won’t appear again for a while, limiting your support options.

	If you send a friend request to another player and it stays as pending, then you cannot see that player’s cards until the request is either accepted (Friend) or rejected/deleted by the sender (Guest). This is probably because the game doesn’t allow you to send a request again if you’ve already done so. (Using a guest support prompts you to send a friend request)

	There is also a specific range of players you can see, which can vary between accounts. From personal experience, this range can be from 100 to as many as 200 players (might include rarely active players?). It is advantageous to have friends who are outside of this range (added offsite or from another account). This is why many players you see in the rankings will normally never show up on your support list.

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	Theater

	If the event has a play, tickets will be given from the point rewards and rarely from practice. Every point counts!

	Each unique actor will only count once. You can’t use both the unbloomed & bloomed card of the same actor for double the points.
	The guest actor does not matter.
	Base points are 500 per ticket, and every event card you use will add extra points.

	If you have the R card, play one show with the original cast (N cards) for the badge. Only bloomed event cards double as original. And if you really want to maximize your points, you can even watch a play with the original cast AFTER the event ends, since you can obtain the badge anytime.

	Then save up the rest of your tickets until you obtain the 1.15mil SSR reward for the max possible bonus points.

	</div>



	<div class="box">

	Rookie Mistakes

	Accidentally pressing “Start Show” instead of “Cancel” on a Matinee. There is no confirmation to start a show if you have enough SP. (So many Matinees in a row...)
	Accidentally pressing “Start Show” with the wrong boost amount. Always make sure you will pass a show before confirming! (I have done this before, ended up wasting an extra SP to pass the show)
	Being shy of a couple hundred points to passing a Finale or Encore with the ideal SP amount. Training your cards at the last minute isn’t the greatest idea. Be prepared if you want to rank! Set up your teams with optimal link skills in advance and keep in mind other possible link skill combos you could use. Farm trophies and coach cards to train and raise the lead skills of your best actors, or at least have them handy in case you do need them. (I did this as well and panicked with seconds on the clock left -- misclicking the wrong boost -- wasting an SP, and then the show expired… yeah...)
	Waiting for one SP to regenerate and then forget to check the app again in time, coming back to an expired timer. It’s handy to write down the time or set an alarm, as short as the timers are, or leave the app idle if it’s only a couple of minutes. (I still do this from time to time ;-; Not my 3 SP Encore… uhh pretend it never happened xD)
	Staying up late, then falling asleep in the middle of an event practice or while waiting for SP. (Yup)

		Gem Management Tips for F2P:
		<ul>
			<li>Don't pull on every banner.
				<ul>
				<li>You could choose to ignore all banners that don't have an event attached to them, as there is currently no guaranteed "pity system" implemented.</li>
				<li>You could choose to ignore all banners that don't feature your best boy(s) as the SSR/SR. <span class="text2">Sometimes, I ignore the featured SR of one of my best boys too if I don't care for the featured SSR(s).</span></li>
				<li>You could choose to ignore banners if you already own an actor's card of the same attribute as the featured SSR. <span class="text2">(See: Actor Management)</span></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Ignore all R gacha cards.
				<ul>
				<li>Can be extended to ignoring event-exclusive badges, which are purely aesthetic and reward only an extra music track.</li>
				<li>Exceptions: R cards for the event you plan to rank in, keep Hisoka's Drama R card if you don't have any of his gacha cards (as of Year 1).</li>
				<li>Why?: Gameplay. SSRs and SRs are more useful for shows (and overall have better art).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Accept that you cannot rank (Top 0.5% - Top 2%) in every event.
				<ul>
				<li>F2P have limited gems and cannot expect to obtain all of the event SSRs fully bloomed.</li>
				<li>It is possible to obtain the event SSR reward (1.15m Pts) and tier as high as T4 (Top 5%) without spending a single dia.</li>
